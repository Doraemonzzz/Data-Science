    "Welcome to Data Science 8: Foundations of Data Science!  Each week you will complete a lab assignment like this one.  You can't learn technical subjects without hands-on practice, so labs are an important part of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, there are some administrative details.\n",
    "\n",
    "Labs constitute 10% of your grade in this course. They're designed to be completed during the scheduled lab time, but you can work on them at home as well. However, you must complete and submit them by 7PM on the Friday of the week they're released. (So, for example, this one is due by 7PM on Friday, August 26.) Any reasonably-complete submission will receive full credit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborating on labs is more than okay -- it's encouraged! You should rarely be stuck for more than a few minutes on questions in labs, so ask a neighbor or an instructor for help. (Explaining things is beneficial, too -- the best way to solidify your knowledge of a subject is to explain it.) Please don't just share answers, though.\n",

    "1. navigate Jupyter notebooks (like this one);\n",
    "2. write and evaluate some basic *expressions* in Python, the computer language of the course;\n",
    "3. call *functions* to use code other people have written; and\n",
    "4. break down Python code into smaller parts to understand it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the middle of the lab, you'll see how to run *automated tests* we've provided to check whether your code is working properly.  When you're done, **follow the instructions at the end of this notebook** to run all the tests and submit your lab.\n",

    "This lab covers parts of [Chapter 3](http://www.inferentialthinking.com/chapters/03/programming-in-python.html) of the online textbook. You should read the book, but not right now. Instead, let's get started!"
