    "Last time, we had our first look at Python and Jupyter notebooks.  So far, we've only used Python to manipulate numbers.  There's a lot more to life than numbers, so Python lets us represent many other types of data in programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll first see how to represent and manipulate another fundamental type of data: text.  A piece of text is called a *string* in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll also see how to invoke *methods*.  A method is very similar to a function.  It just looks a little different because it's tied to a particular piece of data (like a piece of text or a number).\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, you'll see how to work with datasets in Python -- *collections* of data, like the numbers 2 through 5 or the words \"welcome\", \"to\", and \"lab\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In this class, we principally use two kinds of collections:\n",
    "  * **Arrays:** An array is a collection of many pieces of a single kind of data, kept in order.  An array is like a single column in an Excel spreadsheet.\n",
    "  * **Tables:** A table is a collection of many pieces of different kinds of data.  It's like an entire Excel spreadsheet.  Each row of a table represents one entity, and each column contains a different kind of data about each entity.\n",

    "The two building blocks of Python code are *expressions* and *statements*.  An expression is a piece of code that\n",
    "\n",
    "* is self-contained, meaning it would make sense to write it on a line by itself, and\n",
    "* usually has a value.\n",
    "\n",

    "    abs(2 - 3)\n",
    "    max(3, pow(2, abs(2 - 3) + pow(2, 2)))\n",
    "\n",
    "All these expressions but the first are *compound expressions*, meaning that they are actually combinations of several smaller expressions.  `2 + 3` combines the expressions `2` and `3` by addition.  In that example, `2` and `3` are called *subexpressions* because they're expressions that are part of a larger expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *statement* is a whole line of code.  Some statements are just expressions.  The expressions listed above are examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other statements *make something happen* rather than *having a value*.  After they are run, something in the world has changed.  For example, an assignment statement assigns a value to a name.  Here are some assignment statements:\n",
