    "Swain v. Alabama was a US Supreme Court case decided in 1965.  A black man, Swain, was accused of raping a white woman, and had been convicted by an all-white jury.  The jury was selected from a panel of 100 people that contained only 8 black people and 92 people of other ethnicities.  That panel was supposed to be a random sample from the eligible population of Talladega County, which was 26% black and 74% other ethnicities (and, by law, all male).  We will assume there were 16,000 people in all of Talladega County eligible to serve on the jury.\n",

    "Swain's lawyers argued that this reflected a bias in the jury panel selection process.  A five-justice majority of the Supreme Court disagreed, asserting that,\n",
