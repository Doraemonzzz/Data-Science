    "Today's discussion is designed to prepare you for Project 3.  In this project, you'll create a classifier that predicts a song's genre based on its lyrics (the words in the song).  Each observation is a song.  Every song's genre is either hip-hop or country.  There is one attribute for every word that's in any song.  A song's value for an attribute is the *proportion* of the song's lyrics that are that word.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this discussion, we'll limit ourselves to just two attributes: the frequency of the word \"truck\" and the frequency of the word \"style\".  It's easiest to see this with a picture.\n",

    "\n",
    "Whenever you build a classifier, it's important to have a separate dataset to test it on.  This is called a *test set*.  The hollow shapes represent songs in the test set, and the filled-in shapes represent songs in the training set.  The test set songs have been labeled with numbers.\n",

    "**Question 1.** Suppose you train a 1-nearest neighbor classifier on the training set.  For each song in the test set, find its nearest neighbor and draw a line between them.  How will the classifier classify each song in the test set?  Which labels are correct?  (For convenience, we've written in the actual label of each song.)"
