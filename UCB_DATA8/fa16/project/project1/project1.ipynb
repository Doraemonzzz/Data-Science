    "=================\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the first project in Data 8! We will be exploring possible connections between water usage, geography, and income in California. The water data for this project was procured from the [California State Water Resources Control Board](http://www2.pacinst.org/gpcd/table.html) and curated by the [Pacific Institute](http://pacinst.org/). The map data includes [US topography](https://github.com/jgoodall/us-maps), [California counties](https://github.com/johan/world.geo.json/tree/master/countries/USA/CA), and [ZIP codes](http://bl.ocks.org/jefffriesen/6892860).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset on income comes from the IRS ([documented here](http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/13zpdoc.doc)).  We have identified some interesting columns in the dataset, but a full description of all the columns (and a definition of the population in the dataset and some interesting anonymization procedures they used) is available [here](irs_info.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Administrivia\n",
    "##### Piazza\n",
    "While collaboration is encouraged on this and other assignments, sharing answers is never okay. In particular, posting code or other assignment answers publicly on Piazza (or elsewhere) is academic dishonesty. It will result in a reduced project grade at a minimum. If you wish to ask a question and include code, you *must* make it a private post.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Partners\n",
    "You may complete the project with up to one partner. Partnerships are an exception to the rule against sharing answers. If you have a partner, one person in the partnership should submit your project on Gradescope and include the other partner in the submission. (Gradescope will prompt you to fill this in.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your partner *must be in your lab section*.  You can ask your TA to pair you with someone from your lab if youâ€™re unable to find a partner.  (That will happen in lab the week the project comes out.)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Due Date and Checkpoint\n",
    "Part of the project will be due early.  Parts 1 and 2 of the project (out of 3) are due **Tuesday, September 27th at 5PM**.  Unlike the final submission, this early checkpoint  will be graded for completion. It will be worth approximately 10% of the total project grade.  Simply submit your partially-completed notebook as a PDF, as you would submit any other notebook.  (See the note above on submitting with a partner.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire project (parts 1, 2, and 3) will be due **Tuesday, October 4 at 5PM**. (Again, see the note above on submitting with a partner.)\n",

    "#### On to the project!\n",

According to the IRS documentation, all the numerical columns are *totals* -- either total numbers of returns that fall into various categories, or total amounts of money (in thousands of dollars) from returns in those categories.  For example, the column `'N02650'` is the number of returns that included a total income amount, and `'A02650'` is the total amount of total income (in thousands of dollars) from those returns.\n",
