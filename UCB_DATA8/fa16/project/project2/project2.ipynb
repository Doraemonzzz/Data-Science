    "\n",
    "Welcome to Project 2!  You will investigate the relationship between murder and capital punishment (the death penalty) in the United States.  By the end of the project, you should know how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Test whether observed data appears to be a random sample from a distribution\n",
    "2. Analyze a natural experiment\n",
    "3. Implement and interpret a sign test\n",
    "4. Create a function to run a general hypothesis test\n",
    "5. Analyze visualizations and draw conclusions from them\n",

    "While collaboration is encouraged on this and other assignments, sharing answers is never okay. In particular, posting code or other assignment answers publicly on Piazza (or elsewhere) is academic dishonesty. It will result in a reduced project grade at a minimum. If you wish to ask a question and include code, you *must* make it a private post.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Partners\n",
    "You may complete the project with up to one partner. Partnerships are an exception to the rule against sharing answers. If you have a partner, one person in the partnership should submit your project on Gradescope and include the other partner in the submission. (Gradescope will prompt you to fill this in.)\n",

    "##### Due Date and Checkpoint\n",
    "Part of the project will be due early.  Parts 1 and 2 of the project (out of 5) are due **Tuesday, November 1st at 7PM**.  Unlike the final submission, this early checkpoint  will be graded for completion. It will be worth approximately 10% of the total project grade.  Simply submit your partially-completed notebook as a PDF, as you would submit any other notebook.  (See the note above on submitting with a partner.)\n",

    "## 1. Murder rates\n",
    "Punishment for crime has many [philosophical justifications](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/punishment/#ThePun).  An important one is that fear of punishment may *deter* people from committing crimes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the United States, some jurisdictions execute some people who are convicted of particularly serious crimes, like murder.  This punishment is called the *death penalty* or *capital punishment*.  The death penalty is controversial, and deterrence has been one focal point of the debate.  There are other reasons to support or oppose the death penalty, but in this project we'll focus on deterrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key question about deterrence is:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Does instituting a death penalty for murder actually reduce the number of murders?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have a strong intuition in one direction, but the evidence turns out to be surprisingly complex.  Different sides have variously argued that the death penalty has no deterrent effect and that each execution prevents 8 murders, all using statistical arguments!  We'll try to come to our own conclusion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a road map for this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the rest of this section, we'll investigate the main dataset we'll be using.\n",
    "2. In section 2, we'll see how to test null hypotheses like this: \"For this set of U.S. states, the murder rate was equally likely to go up or down each year.\"\n",
    "3. In section 3, we'll apply a similar test to see whether U.S. states that suddenly ended or reinstituted the death penalty were more likely to see murder rates increase than decrease.\n",
    "4. In section 4, we will run some more tests to further claims we had been developing in previous sections. \n",
    "5. In section 5, we'll try to answer our question about deterrence using a visualization rather than a formal hypothesis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The data\n",
    "The main data source for this project comes from a [paper](http://cjlf.org/deathpenalty/DezRubShepDeterFinal.pdf) by three researchers, Dezhbakhsh, Rubin, and Shepherd.  The dataset contains rates of various violent crimes for every year 1960-2003 (44 years) in every US state.  The researchers compiled their data from the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since crimes are committed by people, not states, we need to account for the number of people in each state when we're looking at state-level data.  Murder rates are calculated as follows:\n",

A natural experiment happens when something other than experimental design applies a treatment to one group and not to another (control) group, and we can reasonably expect that the treatment and control groups don't have any other systematic differences.\n",
