In particular, posting code or other assignment answers publicly on Piazza (or elsewhere) is academic dishonesty. It will result in a reduced project grade at a minimum. If you wish to ask a question and include your code or an answer to a written question, you *must* make it a private post.\n",

If you have a partner, one person in the partnership should submit your project on Gradescope and include the other partner in the submission. (Gradescope will prompt you to fill this in.)\n",

Unlike the final submission, this early checkpoint  will be graded for completion. It will be worth approximately 10% of the total project grade.  Simply submit your partially-completed notebook as a PDF, as you would submit any other notebook.  (See the note above on submitting with a partner.)\n",
