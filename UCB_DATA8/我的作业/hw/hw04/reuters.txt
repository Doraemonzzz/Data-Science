<title>LYNG SETS TOUGH U.S. STANCE WITH JAPAN ON BEEF</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 2 - </dateline>U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard
Lyng warned Japan that the failure to remove a longstanding 
import quota on Japanese beef might spark a protectionist
response in the United States.
    "Given the protectionist mood in the Congress and the
country, if I were a leader in Japan I would certainly be very
concerned...and the failure to remove it (the beef quota) might
be very serious," Lyng told a group of U.S cattlemen.
    Lyng said he and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter,
during a visit to Japan later this month, will demand "total
elimination" of the beef import quota by April 1988.
    The current dispute with Japan over semiconductor may
strengthen the U.S. stance in farm trade negotiations, Lyng
said, because Japan does not want a trade war with the U.S.
    Lyng dismissed recent statements in Tokyo that Japan might
retaliate against U.S. products as a result of the
semiconductor dispute.
    "They (Japan) aren't going to pick a fight with us," Lyng
said, adding that with its huge bilateral trade surplus Japan
has more to lose in a trade war than the United States.
    Lyng told the U.S. cattlemen that the quota on Japanese
beef imports does not allow consumers there an adequate choice
in food purchases.
    He said in addition to beef, the U.S. will press for
eliminiation of import barriers on Japan's citrus and rice as
well.
    Lyng noted that Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. farm
products, principally grains and soybeans.

<title>BIOGEN <BGNF> GETS PATENT FROM EUROPEAN OFFICE</title>
<dateline>    CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 26 - </dateline>Biogen Inc said the European
Patent Office granted it a patent covering certain proteins
used to produce a hepatitis B vaccine through genetic
engineering techniques.
    Robert Gottlieb, Biogen spokesman, said the company has
licensed the vaccine on a nonexclusive basis to <Wellcome PLC>,
the British pharmaceutical firm, and is discussing licensing
with other companies.
    Biogen said the patent gives it the right to exclude others
from marketing hepatitis B vaccine in the 11 member countries
of the European Patent Convention.
    Gottlieb said the company has also filed a patent in other
markets, including the U.S. The vaccine is in clinical tests.
    Patents in the biotechnology field are particularly
important as the company with an exclusive patent can reap
large rewards. Recently many of the products of genetic
engineering have become the target of patent lawsuits.
    Merck and Co Inc <MRK> already sells a genetically
engineered hepatitis B vaccine in the U.S. called Recombivax
HB. A subsidiary of <SmithKline Beckman Corp>, SmithKline
Biologicals, based in Belgium, is selling a hepatitis B
vaccine, called Engerix-B, in Belgium.
    A SmithKline spokesman said the vaccine has also been
formally approved in Switzerland and Luxembourg and has been
authorized for market in a number of Far East countries.
    Hepatitis B is a serious liver infection common in many
parts of Africa and southeast Asia where about five pct to 15
pct of the population carry the virus. In the U.S. about
200,000 new cases occur each year.
    Last December the European Patent Ofice rejected Biogen's
patent for alpha-interferon, which Biogen said it will appeal
once it receives a formal written opinion from the office.

<title>IRAN SAYS IT INTENDS NO THREAT TO GULF SHIPPING</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 23 - </dateline>Iran said reports that it intended to
threaten shipping in the Gulf were baseless, and warned the
U.S. And other countries not to interfere in the region.
    Tehran radio, monitored by the BBC, quoted a Foreign
Ministry spokesman as saying any attempt at interference would
be met by "a strong response from Iran and other Moslems in the
world."
     U.S. Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, in remarks
apparently unrelated to the broadcast, said the U.S. Would do
whatever was necessary to keep shipping lanes open in the face
of new Iranian anti-ship missiles in the Gulf.
    The U.S. State Department said two days ago Tehran had been
told of U.S. Concern that Iranian anti-ship missiles posed a
threat to the free flow of oil from the Gulf.
    U.S. Officials have said Iran has new Chinese-made
anti-ship "Silkworm" missiles, which pose a greater threat to
merchant ships than missiles used before.
    The Iranian spokesman said the reports that Iran intended
to attack ships were "misleading propaganda."
    He said Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was the main cause
of tension in the Gulf and said Iran would continue to use "all
its legitimate means to stem the cause of tension."
    Weinberger said in a television interview in the U.S. "We
are fully prepared to do what's necessary to keep the shipping
going and keep the freedom of navigation available in that very
vital waterway."
    "We aren't going into any disclosures or discussions of what
might happen, but we are certainly very sympathetic to and
listening carefully to any suggestions for our assistance in
keeping navigation free in that area," he said.
    Weinberger said U.S warship movements in the Gulf area were
not unusual.
    A U.S. Navy battle group led by the aircraft carrier Kitty
Hawk is currently in the northern Arabian Sea.
    The Iranian spokesman was quoted by Tehran radio as saying
the U.S. Was trying to build up its military presence in the
region.

<text>
<title>PRIMARY GILTS DEALERS NEED NOT BUY AT AUCTIONS</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, April 13 - </dateline>Primary dealers in U.K. Government gilts
will not be required to underwrite the government's offering of
its securities when the first auctions begin in Mid-May, the
Bank of England said.
    In an official notice released today, the Bank said "There
will be no formal or informal underwriting arrangement for the
auctions but the Bank encourages all gilt-edged market makers,
as part of their commitment to the market, to participate
actively in the auction process."
    The Bank was originally believed to have favoured requiring
the dealers to underwrite auctions, which are patterned after
those in the U.S. Treasury market.
    However, the Treasury was believed to have baulked at the
request by the 27 market makers for an allotment commission
which would discourage the largest institutional investors from
placing orders for new stock directly through the Bank of
England, thus denying primary dealers some of their best
customers. Commission would have been passed along to customers
who did place orders via the primary dealers, making it less
expensive to buy through them than to go directly to the Bank.
    Market sources said the Bank had, in its discussions with
the dealers about the upcoming auctions, agreed that the
allotment commission was reasonable if the dealers had a
concurrent commitment to buy at the auction regardless of
market conditions.
    Indeed, the Bank and the gilts dealers are believed to be
disappointed that the Treasury has not agreed to go along with
the plan. However, in its paper, the Bank suggested that any
conditions applied for the first few auctions may be abandoned
or modified in future sales of gilts if they prove inefficient
or unwieldy.
    Among other items in the document, the Bank said its first
auction will consist of up to 1.25 billion stg in conventional
short-dated stock and have a maturity of seven years or less.
    Subsequent auctions to be held in the 1987-88 financial
year would first be of up to one billion stg of long-dated
stock having a maturity of 15 years or longer and then of up to
one billion stg of medium dated stock of seven to 15 years in
maturity.
    The remainder of the gilt-edged funding program would be
met by traditional tap offerings of stock via the government
broker.
    To protect the buyers of the newly auctioned stock, the
Bank has agreed to establish a so-called fallow period, a
28-day period during which it agrees not to issue any new stock
of the same type, and it will not necessarily resume selling
the stock once the fallow period expires.
    In the event that prices offered for the stock to be sold
are substantially out of line with market conditions, the Bank
will agree to take the stock onto its own books.
    The bank would then be free to sell the stock during the
fallow period but not at a price below the minimum tender
price.
    The Bank also said that at least initially, auctions will
be alloted on a bid price basis, a system under which bidders
are allotted stock at the price which they bid.
    However, the Bank said it reserves the right to limit any
money market maker from buying more than 25 pct of a single
auction. The Bank is widely believed to be concerned about
preventing a single market maker from cornering a stock to
drive the price up.
   The Bank has repeatedly signalled its intention to prevent
dealers from cornering the market in a stock, issuing
additional stock, on occasion, to end a market shortage.
    The Bank has also agreed to publish information about the
auction results as soon as possible after the sale is complete,
which is widely expected to be on the same day.
    Information to be released will include the amount of stock
allotted in terms of both competitive and non-competitive bids,
and the highest, lowest and average price of the successful
bids.

<title>BUNDESBANK BOUGHT DOLLARS FOR YEN IN OPEN MARKET</title>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, April 24 - </dateline>The Bundesbank intervened in the open
market to buy dollars for yen ahead of the Frankfurt fixing,
dealers said.
    They said the Bundesbank bought dollars for around 139.80
yen in small amounts in the half-hour running up to the 1100
GMT fix.
    The Bundesbank did not intervene when the dollar was fixed
in Frankfurt at 1.7969 marks.
    Earlier the Bank of Japan bought dollars steadily in the
Far East, but could not stop heavy selling which pushed the
dollar to a post-war low of 139.05 yen at one point.

<title>AUSTRALIAN SUGAR AREAS SAID RECEIVING SOME RAIN</title>
<dateline>    SYDNEY, March 30 - </dateline>Dry areas of the Australian sugar cane
belt along the Queensland coast have been receiving just enough
rain to sustain the 1987 crop, an Australian Sugar Producers
Association spokesman said.
    The industry is not as worried as it was two weeks ago, but
rainfall is still below normal and good soaking rains are
needed in some areas, notably in the Burdekin and Mackay
regions, he said from Brisbane.
    Elsewhere, in the far north and the far south of the state
and in northern New South Wales, the cane crop is looking very
good after heavy falls this month, he said.
    The spokesman said it is still too early to tell what
effect the dry weather will have on the size of the crop, which
is harvested from around June to December.
    He said frequent but light falls in the areas that are
short of moisture, such as Mackay, mean they really only need
about three days of the region's heavy tropical rains to
restore normal moisture to the cane.
    But rainfall in the next two or three weeks will be crucial
to the size of the crop in the dry areas, he said.
    "It's certainly not a disastrous crop at this stage but it
might be in a month without some good falls," he said.

<title>SEC REMOVES OBSTACLE TO FOREIGN FUTURES TRADING</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </dateline>The Securities and Exchange
Commission removed a key regulatory obstacle to trading futures
on designated foreign debt securities on U.S. exchanges.
    The move would allow the Chicago Board of Trade, CBT, to
apply to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, for
approval of a futures contract on yen bonds.
    The CBT has said it may apply for approval of the yen bond
futures contract, a CFTC spokesman said.
    The SEC's action, which was approved by a 4-0 vote,
specifically removes a regulation against trading futures on
designated foreign government debt securities on contract
markets that are not located in the country that issued those
securities.
    Futures on the government debt securities of Japan, Canada
and Great Britain can already be marketed in the United States
under a designated exemption issued by the SEC.
    But the new move would permit U.S. exchanges to apply to
the CFTC for approval of establishing futures contracts on
those securities, SEC officials said.
    The new SEC move would also allow those foreign government
debt securities to be marketed in the United States by
countries other than those that issued the securities, the
officials said.
    Since the foreign government securities underlying the
futures cannot be traded in the United States unless they are
registered with the SEC, settlement and delivery of the futures
would often take place in the foreign country, the SEC
officials said.
    The SEC is also considering expanding futures trading of
additional countries' government securities to be marketed and
traded in the United States, the officials said.

<title>PETRO-CANADA TO DRILL TWO TERRA NOVA TEST WELLS</title>
<dateline>    ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland, March 9 - </dateline>Petro-Canada, Canada's
state-owned oil company, said it will drill two delineation
wells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshore
Newfoundland.
    Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering work
should put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a development
plan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said.
    Depending on time required for regulatory approvals,
construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production as
early as 1991, Petro-Canada said.
    "We have a high degree of confidence that the western
portion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mln
cubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels,
and that we could produce it economicly using a floating
production system," Petro-Canada said.
    The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St.
John's and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, was
discovered by Petro-Canada in 1984.
    "We've had encouraging results from the eastern portion of
the field, and we hope this summer's drilling will prove up
additional reserves there," the company said.
    Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercial
prospect and the company wants to move some of those resources
towards development so it can start generating a return on
investments, Petro-Canada said.
    Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells,
has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block of
the Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field's East
Flank block, a company spokesman said later. Other field
participants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd,
Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, Trillium
Exploration Corp and general partnership PAREX.
    Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field's
Graven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil,
company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada's Calgary
office.
    Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field's East
Flank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels,
he added.
    Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrs
to bring the field to production by about 1991, and the
development budget could double if the company builds a
production system combining both blocks in the field, he said.
    Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven block
would produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average daily
production, with a production system that would have maximum
capacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said in
answer to a query.
    The company estimates a production system combining both
Graven and East Flank blocks in the Terra Nova field could
produce about 45,000 bpd average daily production, he said.

<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </dateline>Swiss National Bank President Pierre
Languetin said a wider interest rate differential between the
dollar and stronger currencies was needed to brake the dollar's
fall.
    At a news conference, he said Japan and West Germany could
try to stimulate their economies further by expanding money
supply, but he added "I'm not so sure it would be desirable if
monetary policy became more expansive.
    "But what would be useful is a greater differential in
interest rates," he said.

<dateline>     Toronto, June 2 - </dateline>The public stock offering Amoco Canada
plans if it succeeds in its 5.2 billion-dlr takeover of Dome
Petroleum Ltd <DMP> will be worth more than one billion
Canadian dlrs, a published report said.
    Public stockholders would own at least 15 pct of Amoco
Canada, although Amoco plans to raise the level of Canadian
participation higher than that, Amoco Canada president Donald
Stacy said in an interview in the Toronto Star.
    Stacy would not say how much higher, adding that that
question will be the subject of discussions between Amoco and
Investment Canada, the federal agency which reviews foreign
takeovers of Canadian companies, the newspaper said.
   
    Amoco Canada plans to make its submission to the agency
next Thursday.
    Stacy said the issue would be sold in stages and that the
first stage would be worth 200 mln to 300 mln Canadian dlrs,
the Star said. The initial offering would not take place until
at least one year after Amoco acquired Dome, to allow the two
operations to merge.

<title>AUSTRALIAN OPPOSITION LEADER SACKS PREDECESSOR</title>
<dateline>    SYDNEY, March 23 - </dateline>Australian opposition leader John Howard
sacked from the shadow cabinet Andrew Peacock, who is a former
foreign minister and Howard's predecessor, party officials
said.
    The officials said the move could lead to the collapse of
the opposition coalition between the Liberal and National
parties, which has been under severe strain in recent weeks.
    In a television interview yesterday prime minister Bob
Hawke said he might call an early election if strife within the
opposition undermined business confidence and hurt Australia's
economic recovery.
    "The opposition have not only destabilised themselves, they
have prostituted the political and economic debate by putting
up economic nostrums and stupidities that are destabilizing
business confidence," Hawke said.
    Howard relegated Peacock to the back benches after the
Melbourne Sun published an alleged telephone conversation
between Peacock and another opposition member in which Peacock
was critical of Howard's leadership. The paper said the call
was recorded by an unidentified man using an electronic radio
scanner. In a statement Howard said the conversation was
damaging to the party and implied disloyalty to him.
    Peacock told reporters he accepted Howard's right to "hire
and fire." He refused to answer questions about any leadership
challenge.
    Liberal party officials said the move against Peacock could
encourage his supporters to mount a challenge to Howard's
leadership. Peacock was ousted as opposition leader by Howard
in September 1985, after losing the 1984 general election to
Hawke.
    Queensland premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, a veteran
National Party member, recently campaigned against Howard's
leadership and urged his party to split from the coalition.

<title>RENISON GOLDFIELDS EXTENDS LYELL COPPER MINE LIFE</title>
<dateline>    SYDNEY, March 17 - </dateline>The Renison Goldfields Consolidated Ltd
<RGFJ.S> (RGC) Mt Lyell copper mine in Tasmania will stay open
for an extra five years following a new aid package from the
state government, RGC said in a statement.
    The mine had been scheduled to close in 1989 after the 40
series stopes were mined, but will now stay open until the
deeper 50 and 60 series have played out, probably in 1994.
    The Australian dollar's fall since 1985 also improved the
local dollar copper price, making the company profitable and
justifying the mining of deeper reserves at a copper grade of
about 1.95 pct against about 1.60 pct now, the firm said.
    Ore output will be cut, but the higher grades will keep
contained-copper output at current levels of about 24,000
tonnes a year, it said. Capital expenditure of about 18 mln
dlrs will be required over the life of the new plan, RGC said.
    The latest aid package is the third since 1977 for RGC, a
major employer in Queenstown on the thinly populated west coast
of Tasmania.
    The mine was kept open in 1985 after Tasmania gave RGC 10
mln dlrs in aid. The new package includes an eight mln dlr
advance to RGC at the long-term bond rate, power concessions
and deferred royalties and payroll taxes.

<title>TOSHIBA HOPES EXPORTS TO U.S. NOT HURT</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, June 1 - </dateline>A senior Toshiba Corp <TSBA.T> executive
said he hoped the alleged illegal export of high technology
equipment to the Soviet Union by a Toshiba subsidiary would not
hurt the parent company's exports to the U.S.
    Toshiba's 50-pct subsidiary <Toshiba Machine Co Ltd> "is a
completely independent company with independent management,"
Toshiba Corp senior vice-president Osamu Iemura told a press
conference.
    "We want to have that fact understood overseas," he said.
    Iemura said he had no information to suggest the U.S.
Defence Department had broken off talks with Toshiba on the
possible procurement of lap top computers because of the
illegal exports by Toshiba Machine.
    Kyodo News Agency, quoting the weekly magazine U.S. News
and World Report, said on Saturday the U.S. Air Force had
decided to cancel an agreement to buy 100 mln dlrs worth of
computers because of Toshiba Machine's illegal exports.
    "We have no contract. The U.S. Defence Department has been
negotiating for procurement with several companies including
Toshiba," Iemura said.
    Last week, police said they had arrested two Toshiba
Machine employees on suspicion of illegally exporting high
technology equipment to the Soviet Union.
    The Japanese government has already banned further
shipments of goods to Communist states by Toshiba Machine for
one year and by its export agency C. Itoh and Co Ltd <CITT.T>
for three months.

<title>DEUTSCHE BABCOCK RIGHTS ISSUE PRICED AT 165 MARKS</title>
<dateline>    OBERHAUSEN, West Germany, March 18 - </dateline>Deutsche Babcock AG
<DBCG.G> said an issue price of 165 marks had been set on a
two-for-five rights issue of shares which will raise nominal
capital by 100 mln marks to 350 mln marks.
    The subscription period for the offer runs from March 26 to
April eight, it added.
    Babcock shares opened at 222.2 marks in Frankfurt after a
close of 226 yesterday. Babcock, which has set an unchanged
three mark a share dividend on 1985/86 business, announced last
week that Iran was selling its 25.2 pct holding in the company.
These shares will be placed with institutional investors.
    The rights issue will bring Deutsche Babcock 330 mln marks,
which share market analysts said was likely be used partly to
finance expansion, especially in environment technology.
    However, one analyst who follows the stock for a major
Frankfurt bank said the capital increase would also be used to
bring capital ratios back into order after the company suffered
heavy losses in the early 1980s.
    This analyst said Babcock had used reserves to cover these
losses, which were due to problems linked with three major
contracts in the Middle East. The parent company made a net
loss in the year to end-September 1982 of 389 mln marks.
    Deutsche Babcock has not yet presented details of its
results in the 1985/86 period, but it has said profits rose
from the group net of 32.1 mln marks in 1984/85.
    The share market analysts saw no particular problems in the
pricing of the new Babcock shares but said the timing was
unfortunate.
    The government is planning to sell its 25.55 pct stake in
VEBA AG <VEBG.F> this month, in a transaction worth a likely
2.5 billion marks. The Babcock rights issue also coincides with
a large capital increase by the Aachener und Muenchener
insurance group.
    The heavy volume of new stock coming on to the market has
generally put pressure on West German stocks which have also
suffered because of export problems caused by the high mark.
    Analysts have linked the pending capital increase with
Iran's decision to sell its holding in Babcock, held since
1975.
    When the Iranian decision was announced last week, the
market took the news calmly. Analysts said today the
combination of the Iranian sale and the rights issue would not
have a negative effect on the Babcock share because the direct
placement of the Iranian holding with institutional investors
both in Germany and abroad would shield the price from falls.

<title>REAGAN AND BAKER BEGIN TASK OF REBUILDING</title>
<author>    By Peter Szekely</author>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </dateline>After a week that left his presidency
shaken and his popularity at a new low, Ronald Reagan and his
new chief of staff today begin trying to revive an
administration tattered by the Iran-contra arms scandal.
    Reagan and former Senate Republican leader Howard Baker,
whose appointment as White House chief of staff won bipartisan
praise, will begin mapping strategy to deal with scathing
criticism by a report on his failed bid to trade U.S. arms with
Iran for help in freeing Ameican hostages in Lebanon.
    Among the chores facing Reagan's new inner circle is
assessing the damage the 300-page Tower commission report has
done to the nomination of Robert Gates to succeed William Casey
as the new head of the Central Intelligence Agency.
    White House officials are checking to see how much support
Gates, a 43-year old career spy agency bureaucrat, would have
if his nomination is submitted to the full Senate for a vote,
Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said.
    Appearing on the NBC News program, "Meet the Press," the
Kansas senator said the Gates nomination "could be in some
difficulty."
    Aides said that Gates' future would be given high priority
by Baker.
    Even though he was not deeply implicated in the arms sale
scandal, lawmakers said Senate confirmation of the Gates
nomination is not assured and, even if won, would come only
after months of congressional probes into the affair.
    "He has the smell of Iran on him," said former Nevada Sen.
and Reagan confidant Paul Laxalt. "He is a victim."
    Laxalt, appearing on the ABC News program, "This Week With
David Brinkley," bluntly admitted "the Gates nomination is in
trouble." Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn said
the odds are now slightly against confirmation of Gates.
    When asked on the syndicated television program, "John
McLaughlin: One on One," if he thought Gates would be confirmed,
the Georgia Democrat shot back: "I wouldn't bet any money on it.
    "I think this report hurts that," Nunn said. "It indicates
that the National Security Council had policy-type influence
over intelligence-type activities and we're going to go into
that with Mr. Gates.
    Only a day after it was issued last week, the Tower report
prompted the abrupt exit of Donald Regan as White House chief
of staff.
    Regan, the former Wall Street executive and Treasury
secretary who has been the president's top aide for the past
two years, was assigned the lion's share of the blame for the
botched handling of the Iran arms sale.
    The report blamed Regan for the "chaos that descended on the
White House" since it was first revealed last November that
profits from the Iran arms sales had been diverted to contra
rebels fighting the leftist Nicaraguan government.
    The two other victims of the scandal are former National
Security Adviser Vice Adm. John Poindexter who resigned and
Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North who was fired after it was
disclosed last November 23 that profits from the Iran arms sale
were diverted to the contras. The two, pictured by the Tower
commission as the key operators of the Iran arms deal, have
refused to testify.
    Reagan, who freely admits disliking details, is portrayed
in the Tower report as a befuddled chief executive whose
inattention let his aides run away with his foreign policy.
    That perception has wrecked Reagan's popularity and
threatened to condemn him to lame duck status until he leaves
office in January 1989. A recent Newsweek magazine poll found
that just 40 pct of Americans approved of Reagan's leadership,
a record low, and a third believed he should consider
resignation.
    After meeting with aides over the weekend and poring over
the meaty report of the commission headed by former Texas Sen.
John Tower, Reagan is now preparing for a nationwide television
address this week to respond to the criticisms of his
presidency.

<title>BANKAMERICA <BAC> SAYS IT WILL MAKE DEBT OFFER</title>
<dateline>    SAN FRANCISCO, March 16 - </dateline>BankAmerica Corp Chairman A.W.
Clausen said the bank holding company plans to go foward with
its one-billion-dlr debt offering, but declined to specify
when.
    Speaking to the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, Clausen
said that during the coming months, "at the appropriate time,
we will be placing or underwriting for equities."
    "We do need to improve our capital. We are in registration.
For the moment, we filed a one-billion-dlr shelf registration
for approval by the SEC, which we believe will be
approved very shortly," he said.
    On January 26, BankAmerica filed a shelf offering for up to
one billion dlrs of preferred stock and subordinated capital
notes.
    The offering was seen by the banking industry as one of the
major deterrents to First Interstate Bancorp's <I> take over
bid, which it withdrew on February 9.
    Since then, banking analysts have speculated BankAmerica
may do well to defer action on the offering, while it continues
to attempt to improve its financial situation.
    Clausen said despite improvement in the past quarter,
BankAmerica must do more to improve its capital ratios.

<title>BRAZIL DEBT SEEN PARTNER TO HARD SELL TACTICS</title>
<author>    By Brian Killen, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, March 5 - </dateline>Brazil's recent announcement of a
suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign
debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views
among many international economists and commodities analysts
that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987.
    The developing world's most indebted nation is also its
most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as
coffee and soybeans, and might maximize foreign exchange
revenue by selling hard on world markets, economists said.
    "That sounds like a reasonable strategy. But there is no
way they can trade their way out of this situation," Aldo
Roldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase
Econometrics, said.
    Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the
problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted
world markets, but also had to work to make its position on
foreign exchange markets more profitable.
    "Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and
exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange
rates," Roldan said.
    The Chase economist also said commodities markets were
depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a
country like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50
pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23
billion dlrs.
    But he added: "They are always pretty aggressive and they
have good foreign marketing channels."
    Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be
coffee, and even without background pressure from foreign
creditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit the
market this year with a vengeance.
    Negotiations between International Coffee Organization
(ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up
earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing
each other of intransigence.
    "Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations,
which others wanted changed," one senior coffee dealer said.
    The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to
preserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he said
Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others
would suffer.
    Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but
as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the
dealer said.
    "If they do come into the market at this level it will go
lower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents,"
he said.
    New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents
lower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distant
deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit.
    President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster
told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has
no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of
the ICO talks on export quotas.
    Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the
focus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. "They
will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been,"
according to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc.
    Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus
difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the
Brazil soybean crop. "Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and
they can't afford to store the crops," he said.
    The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time
about large South American crops developing under near ideal
conditions towards record yields.
    "We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than
usual, this year in our (U.S.) exports," Loewy said.
    Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean
Association (ASA), said this year's Brazilian soybean harvest
could total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.
    Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices
are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the
vulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.
    Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a
reduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to
farmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.
    He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the
soybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices
by keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can
forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the
loan.
    "We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) are
starting to harvest and starting to export," Eshleman said. But
he added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below
10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently.
    Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel
Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much
as it can this year because of its economic situation.
    He said the debt situation was a major consideration. "The
Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for
storage," he added.
    Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil
would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said
it would not make a big difference.
    On other commodity markets, Brazil's selling impact may be
muted no matter its need to generate capital.
    Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which
could limit exports to the world market, analysts said. The
country may have oversold and be unable to honor export
commitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by
consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will
give it little room to stretch exports, they said.
    Brazil's other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of
surplus. "Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it
fell, so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa and
find many more markets for it," one analyst said.
    "If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would
collapse and they can't afford to do that," she added.

<title>PRESIDENT REAGAN VOWS TO VETO ANY TAX INCREASE</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 19 - </dateline>President Ronald Reagan said he
would veto any tax increases voted by Congress.
    "My pledge to veto any tax rate increase remains rock solid,"
Reagan said during a televised news conference.
     The president said he opposed efforts by some members of
Congress to back away from deficit reduction targets set by the
Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law. He urged passage of a
constitutional amendment to balance the budget.
    "It's time Congress cut the federal budget and left the
family budget alone," Reagan said.
    He said the congressional budget process was in desperate
need of reform and urged passage of an amendment to the U.S.
constitution that would require a balanced federal budget.
    "This yearly deficit feeding process must stop," he added. "We
must act now to pass a constitutional amendment to balance the
budget."
    In the meantime, he said, Congress cannot back away from
the deficit reduction goals set by federal law he said.

    National Westminster said that it was responding to general

    Its move followed a signal from the Bank of England earlier

base rate, a surprise move following its strong signals last
week that such a move would be premature.
    However, since then the pound has continued to gain
strongly.

<title>CANADA CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICIT UP IN QUARTER</title>
<dateline>    OTTAWA, March 3 - </dateline>Canada's current account deficit widened
to a seasonally adjusted 2.27 billion dlrs in the fourth
quarter from a deficit of 1.94 billion dlrs in the third,
Statistics Canada said.
    The shortfall for the full year rose to 8.81 billion dlrs
from 1985's 584 mln dlr deficit, the federal agency said.
    The agency said the rise in the merchandise surplus, to
2.77 billion dlrs from 2.20 billion dlrs in the third quarter,
was more than offset by high deficits in servicies and
investment. The total non-merchandise deficit grew to 5.04
billion dlrs from 4.14 billion dlrs.
    The current account deficit was 912 mln dlrs in the fourth
quarter of 1985.
    In the capital account, not seasonally adjusted, there was
a total net inflow of 4.76 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter,
up from a net inflow of 3.22 billion dlrs in the third quarter
quarter.
    The total net capital inflow rose to 13.74 billion dlrs in
1986 from 7.68 billion dlr in 1985.

<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 24 - </dateline>The U.S. Agriculture Department is
seeking comments on common provisions of the 1988 wheat,
feedgrains, cotton and rice programs.
    It said many program provisions are common to all the
commodity programs and decisions made in regard to one will
likely apply to other program crops.
    It asked for specific comments on the percentage reduction
for acreage limitation requirements under the wheat program,
the loan and purchase level, and whether a marketing loan, the
inventory reduction program and related provisions
should be implemented.
    The percentage acreage reduction of between 20 and 30 pct
must be announced no later than June 1, 1987 for wheat, it
said.

<title>CHEMLAWN <CHEM> RISES ON HOPES FOR HIGHER BIDS</title>
<author>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </dateline>ChemLawn Corp <CHEM> could attract a
higher bid than the 27 dlrs per share offered by Waste
Management Inc <WNX>, Wall Street arbitrageurs said.
    Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in
over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1
mln shares changing hands by late afternoon.
    "This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs,
maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing
bidder," an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer,
announced before the opening today, expires March 25.
    "This is totally by surprise," said Debra Strohmaier, a
ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly
scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management
announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not
certain when it would be ready. 
    She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact
between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.
    "I think they will resist it," said Elliott Schlang,
analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. "Any company that
doesn't like a surprise attack would."
    Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender
offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn
could try to find a white knight if does not want to be
acquired by Waste Management.
    Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said
ServiceMaster Companies L.P. <SVM> or Rollins Inc <ROL> were
examples of companies that could be interested.
    ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S.
company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and
herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of
wastes.
    Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to
another company that wants to capitalize on a strong
residential and commercial distribution system.
    Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had
catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but
the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.
    Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the
fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for
the full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter.
    Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of
individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice.

<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 29 - </dateline>Contel Corp's telecommunications
equipment unit is the most likely candidate for sale by the
Atlanta-based telecommunications company, Wall Street analysts
said.
    "Executone is at the top of the list," said one analyst,
referring to Contel's loss-riden telecommunications equipment
unit. "The question is, who would take it?" he added.
    The company, forecasting a 15 pct drop in 1987 operating
earnings over last year, said late today that it is reviewing
all operations in an effort aimed at "maximizing long-term
stockholder value."
    Analysts also said Contel's federal systems division, which
has been hit with several executive defections, may also be put
on the block.
    Contel officials declined to comment on the possibility of
selling any operations. However, the company indicated in a
statement that it was closely evaluating the telecommunications
and federal systems units.

<title>AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT MUST CUT SPENDING, ANZ SAYS</title>
<dateline>    SYDNEY, April 13 - </dateline>The government must announce harsh cuts
in spending in its May 14 economic statement if it is to give
an adequate response to Australia's economic problems, the ANZ
Banking Group Ltd <ANZA.S> said.
    Cuts of two billion dlrs would be insufficient against the
backdrop of a 12 billion dlr government deficit and a 14
billion dlr current account deficit, it said in its monthly
Business Indicators publication.
    "For the past two years, the government has struggled with
an economic reality that demands measures beyond those which it
sees as politically practicable," it said.
    The political climate meant there would be a continued
over-reliance on monetary policy to hold the exchange rate and
maintain confidence in economic management, ANZ said.
    "The cost of this approach is that the much-needed revival
of business investment will be further postponed," it said.
    The economy was now on a modest growth upswing boosted by
export and import-replacement industries which had created a
false suggestion that the worst adjustments to the balance of
payments crisis were past. "Unfortunately, successful adjustment
to Australia's deep-seated economic problems remains a
long-term process," it said.
    In its economic forecasts, ANZ said it expected moderate
overall economic growth with gross domestic product (GDP)
rising 2.7 pct this year and 2.4 pct in 1988.
    The current account deficit would narrow to five pct of GDP
this year and 4.3 pct in 1988 and net foreign debt would grow
strongly from 81 billion at the end of 1986 to 97.2 billion at
end-1987 and 110.3 billion a year later.
    Inflation would fall to 8.5 pct in 1987 and 7.5 pct in 1988
from 8.9 pct in 1986 and further falls in real wages were
expected, ANZ said.

<title>USDA'S AMSTUTZ CONFIDENT OF EC OILS TAX DEFEAT</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </dateline>U.S. Agriculture Undersecretary
Daniel Amstutz said he was confident that a European Community,
EC, proposal to tax vegetable and marine oils and fats would
not be approved by the Community.
    Asked by Reuters if he was confident the plan eventually
would be defeated, Amstutz said, "Yes, I am, but I also know
that things like this take constant vigilance."
    The USDA official said the EC Council of Ministers held an
ad hoc meeting yesterday.
    Commenting on that meeting, he said, "So far, so good."
    Yesterday British Farm Minister Michael Jopling said enough
EC states appeared to be opposed to the proposals by the
commission for a 330 European Currency Unit a tonne tax on
vegetable oils, fats and marine oils for the moves to be
defeated.

<title>U.S. BANKS LIKELY TO LIFT PRIME RATES AGAIN SOON</title>
<author>    By Martin Cherrin, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </dateline>Major U.S. banks may lift prime
lending rates again within days due to recent increases in
their borrowing costs and speculation the Federal Reserve is
nudging up interest rates to help the dollar, economists said.
    In what was the first prime rate boost since mid-1984, most
banks in early April lifted their rates a quarter point to
7-3/4 pct, citing a reduced gap between the prime and their own
cost of money. That spread has narrowed again.
    "A prime rate increase could happen as soon as tonight,"
said Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc.
    Brusca said a quarter-point prime rate rise to eight pct is
justified because the spread between banks' cost of funds and
the prime rate has narrowed to less than three quarters of a
percentage point.
    He said that spread had averaged around 1.4 percentage
points since last October until it fell below one point and
triggered the April prime rate rise at most banks.
    "We could easily have another prime rate increase as soon
as this week," said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston and Co.
    "We've got a fairly good chance of a prime rate rise in the
near future," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corp.
    "Based on the spread between the prime rate and funding
costs, you would ordinarily see a prime rate increase now,"
said Harold Nathan, economist at Wells Fargo Bank.
    However, he said banks may be reluctant to lift the prime
because that would dampen already fairly weak business loan
demand and because some are not sure the Fed will maintain
recent upward pressure on money market interest rates.
    Nathan believes the Fed has let market pressures lift
short-term rates in recent days to help the ailing dollar. He
said "if there is widespread belief money market rates will
stay high, a prime rate rise could occur at any time."
    Fed officials have long expressed concern that too steep a
dollar drop could help rekindle U.S. inflation. As the dollar
fell to a 40-year low against the yen Friday, currency traders
said the Fed and other central banks supported the dollar.
    In addition to buying dollars outright, another way to
stabilize the U.S. currency would be for the Fed to push U.S.
interest rates higher relative to overseas rates.
    Based particularly on the Fed's reserve management actions
on Friday and today, Nathan of Wells Fargo said "it has become
clear that the Fed is not fully resisting upward rate pressure
in the market. It is supplying fewer reserves than are needed."
    Bank funding costs and other short and long-term interest
rates rose sharply Friday and today on heightened speculation
that the Fed is gently firming monetary policy.
    That was because the Fed supplied far fewer reserves in the
market than most economists had expected.
    On Friday, the Fed added reserves indirectly and in small
amounts via one billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements
with the Federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another
high at 6-5/16 pct. With funds trading even higher at 6-1/2 pct
today, the Fed arranged only a slightly larger 1.5 billion dlr
round of customer repurchase agreements.
    "The Fed's actions on Friday and today show that it is
offering only token resistance to upward funds rate pressures,"
said Jones of Lanston.
    "The Fed is focusing its policy attention mainly on the
need to defend the dollar," Jones said. He believes it is
merely shading policy toward restraint now, "but to have a
major impact on the dollar, the Fed will have to tighten policy
overtly at some point."
    Jones expects the Fed to foster higher market rates by
becoming more restrictive in supplying reserves and, within
four to six weeks, to raise its discount rate from 5-1/2 pct.
    Jones said a U.S. discount rate increase to six pct might
well be accompanied by West German and Japanese rate cuts to
further aid the dollar.
    Given likely Fed policy firming, he said both the yield on
30-year Treasury bonds (about 8.30 pct now) and the prime rate
may be at 8-1/2 pct at end-June and nine pct by year's end.
    "The jury is still out on whether the Fed is tightening
policy to defend the dollar," said Leslie of Discount Corp. He
said tax-date pressures have been pushing up Fed funds lately.
Leslie said Fed actions and reserve data once these pressures
abate will show whether or not it is firming policy.

<dateline>    LONDON, March 19 - </dateline>Cuban sugar output this season (1986/87)
is put at around 7.5 mln tonnes raw value by broker C.Czarnikow
in its monthly sugar market review.
    Allowing for around 700,000 tonnes for the current year's
domestic usage it would leave around 6.8 mln tonnes for export
of which, Czarnikow estimates, about 3.7 mln tonnes will be
taken by the USSR, 1.530 mln by other socialist countries and
the remainder for delivery to non-socialist bloc destinations.
    Czarnikow also estimated USSR 1986/87 production at 8.75
mln tonnes raw value which when added to the 3.7 mln imports
from Cuba and set against its estimated domestic and export
needs of 14.2 mln tonnes will leave a gap of 1.75 mln tonnes to
be acquired from the world market. Soviet purchases to date may
not be far short of that quantity, Czarnikow said.

<title>SHULTZ WELCOMES TOKYO ECONOMIC PACKAGE</title>
<dateline>    ROME, June 2 - </dateline>U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said
the 6,000 billion yen economic package announced by Tokyo last
week went further than the U.S. Had expected.
    But he said the U.S. Would not lift the selective economic
sanctions it imposed on Japanese imports in April until Tokyo
changed its sales policies concerning computer microchips.
    Speaking in a televised news conference linking several
European capitals, Shultz said it was heartening that the
Japanese had confronted the problem of stimulating domestic and
global demand.

    "There is an even greater amount of stimulus than was
originally thought," said Shultz, speaking from Washington.
    "It is a lot more than nothing. It is more than was talked
about when (Prime Minister Yasuhiro) Nakasone was here.
    "It involves a major reduction in tax rates and we believe
that getting the tax burden down is one way of stimulating the
economy," he added.
    But asked by Japanese reporters, also linked into the news
conference, whether the positive reaction meant the U.S. Might
decide at next week's Venice summit to lift its sanctions on
some Japanese electronic goods, Shultz replied:
    "These sanctions were undertaken on the basis of an
agreement that had been reached between the United States and
Japan on various sale practices and prices relating to the chip
market.
    "They will be lifted as the facts of change by Japan to the
agreement that it made become evident."
    He said U.S. Officials had only been able to monitor the
situation for a month and that it was impossible to determine a
trend on only one month's data.
    The U.S. Imposed 100 pct import duties on personal
computers, colour televisions and power tools, alleging that
Japan had violated last September's bilateral agreement by
selling computer chips at below fair market value.
    Shultz said West Germany and other nations would also do
well to look at what they could do to stimulate demand.
    Asked whether the U.S. Could reasonably ask its allies to
take action to stimulate the world economy without a bold
American initiative to reduce the size of the federal budget
deficit, Shultz said moves were already underway to tackle the
problem.
    He said by the end of the current fiscal year the deficit
would probably be reduced by around 35 billion dlrs against
last year, and that the budget being worked on this year would
contain a major reduction.

<title>STRIKES AGAINST WAGE FREEZE SPREAD IN YUGOSLAVIA</title>
<dateline>    BELGRADE, March 17 - </dateline>Strikes against a government freeze on
wages spread to most regions of Yugoslavia last week, the
official news agency Tanjug said last night.
    It said thousands of workers were involved, and officials
feared more strikes were on the way.
    At least 60 strikes have taken place around Yugoslavia in
the past two weeks, but most of those previously reported were
in the northern republic of Croatia.
    Prime Minister Branko Mikulic imposed the wage freeze last
month in an effort to curb rampant inflation, now running at an
annual rate of almost 100 pct.
    The government froze wages at their level in the fourth
quarter of 1986 and said any future rises must be linked to
productivity.
    The measure met widespread disapproval. Even some senior
executives of major industrial enterprises have criticised the
freeze in interviews with Tanjug.
    The agency said strikes took place last week in the
southern republic of Montenegro and the predominantly ethnic
Albanian province of Kosovo. In the central republic of Bosnia
and Hercegovina 1,700 workers struck, while many teachers in
Belgrade refused to take their paychecks.

<title>U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - BUDGET DEFICIT</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 20 - </dateline>Economists' forecasts vary widely for
the February monthly U.S. budget deficit to be released today.
However most agree on one point -- that the budget deficit for
the 1987 fiscal year will narrow substantially from 1986
levels.
    The report is likely to mean very little to the moribund
credit markets, however, which have been stilled by a stable
dollar and perceptions of steady Federal Reserve policy.
    Economists said that a leaner federal budget could help the
credit markets if it lowers the Treasury's financing needs and
results in lower interest rates, but investors may not respond
until they see evidence that this is taking place.
    Economists' forecasts for the February deficit range from
20 billion dlrs to nearly 30 billion dlrs, with most forecasts
clustered in the 26-28 billion dlrs range. This compares with a
deficit of 24.6 billion dlrs in February 1986.
    In January, the budget deficit was 2.1 billion dlrs,
leaving the fiscal year-to-date deficit at 65.6 billion dlrs.
    Most economists expect the 1987 fiscal deficit to fall to
180-190 billion dlrs from 220.7 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986.
    Kathleen Stephansen of Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette
Securities Corp, expects a 26.3 billion dlr February budget
deficit, and a 186.5 billion dlr fiscal 1987 deficit.
    Stephansen expects widening in the February deficit
relative to last year based on two developments.
    First, total revenues showed a slowdown in their yearly
growth rate relative to prior months' growth rates, she said,
as corporate and individual tax payments net of tax refund
payments appear to have been weak in February.
    "The second factor... is relatively strong outlay
performance," Stephansen wrote in a weekly report. "Data
available to date suggest that their year-over-year growth is
close to 4.3 pct, well above the 0.5 pct average that prevailed
in the last four months of the fiscal year."
    Joe Liro of S.G. Warburg Securities and Co expects the
February budget deficit to total 26-28 billion dlrs and the
fiscal 1987 deficit to be 190 billion dlrs.
    He said that as a result of the change in the 1987 tax code
and the new structure for determining withholding of personal
income tax payments, the Treasury is receiving less tax
receipts than it received at this time last year.
    "The Administration compounded a tricky situation by saying
how difficult it is to fill out the new W-4 tax forms he said.
"The wage earner was underwithholding at the beginning of the
year and continues to be underwithheld."
    By contrast, Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Government
Securities Inc said that many taxpayers have probably delayed
filling out the new tax withholding forms, so that this has not
been a drag on tax receipts as others have argued.
    "The first half of the year brought strong tax receipts
from capital gains and the repeal of the investment tax credit,
which is expected to contribute a substantial portion of the
corporate taxes to be paid this week," he said in the firm's
weekly credit market memo.
    He forecast a February budget deficit of 20 billion dlrs,
and a fiscal 1987 deficit of 180 billion dlrs.
    In March, McCarthy expects to see a deficit of 23 to 24
billion dlrs compared with 30 billion dlrs in March 1986.
    But economists agreed that the federal budget deficit is
far from occupying center stage in the credit market's focus
and is unlikely to have an impact now regardless of its size.
    Yesterday, the key 7-1/2 pct Treasury bonds of 2016 closed
unchanged at 99-28/32 to yield 7.51 pct after trading in a
narrow range throughout the session.
    Fed funds traded from six pct to 6-1/8 pct yesterday, up
slightly from Wednesday's 5.97 pct average, and are expected to
open within that range today.

<title>VESSEL LOST IN PACIFIC WAS CARRYING LEAD</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, June 18 - </dateline>The 37,635 deadweight tonnes bulk carrier
Cumberlande, which sank in the South Pacific last Friday, was
carrying a cargo which included lead as well as magnesium ore,
a Lloyds Shipping Intelligence spokesman said.
    He was unable to confirm the tonnages involved.
    Trade reports circulating the London Metal Exchange said
the vessel, en route to New Orleans from Newcastle, New South
Wales, had been carrying 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates.
Traders said this pushed lead prices higher in early morning
trading as the market is currently sensitive to any fundamental
news due to its finely balanced supply/demand position and low
stocks.
    Trade sources said that 10,000 tonnes of lead concentrates
could convert to around 5,000 tonnes of metal, although this
depended on the quality of the concentrates.
    A loss of this size could cause a gap in the supply
pipeline, particularly in North America, they noted. Supplies
there have been very tight this year and there is a strike at
one major producer, Cominco, and labour talks currently being
held at another, Noranda subsidiary Brunswick Mining and
Smelting Ltd.

<title>BONN SEEN REJECTING NEW GROWTH MEASURES AT SUMMIT</title>
<author>    By Anthony Williams, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    BONN, June 1 - </dateline>West Germany will stand firm at next week's
economic summit in Venice against foreign pressure to follow
Japan's example of a multi-billion dlr package to stimulate the
economy, West German officials said.
    They conceded Japan's announcement last week of a 6,000
billion yen plan to bolster its economy would throw the
spotlight back on West Germany, which would face redoubled
calls from its partners to stimulate sluggish growth.
    (See ECRA page for latest Economic Spotlights)
    This view has already been voiced in Washington, where
officials spoke at the weekend of behind-the-scenes
consultations with Chancellor Helmut Kohl with the aim of
securing a quick pledge to take action on the economy.
    Italy's central bank governor Carlo Ciampi has also
criticized West Germany's reluctance "to utilize its economic
potential" for expansionary policies.
    But West German officials said it was virtually
inconceivable that Kohl would make any concessions in Venice
despite a sharp economic downswing at the start of this year.
    "There is just no room for manoeuvre for any economic moves,"
said one official, echoing statements by both Kohl and Finance
Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg.
    Stoltenberg already has problems finding the cash to
finance a series of tax cuts promised for 1990, and has said
his budget is now stretched to the limit.
    He is reluctantly letting government borrowing rise while
federal income falls as a result of the tax cuts, which he
hopes will stimulate growth and satisfy foreign critics.
    "West Germany is exhausting to the furthest possible limit
its fiscal scope as far as growth and employment is concerned,"
Stoltenberg said last month.
    But U.S. Treasury Assistant Secretary David Mulford said
Europeans and the U.S. Were worried by flagging German growth.
    "We and others are concerned about the continued signs of
weakness in the German economy," he said. Other U.S. Officials
said France shared these worries.
    Kohl will go to Venice only days after the publication of
figures expected to show that the West German economy actually
contracted in the first three months of 1987.
    West Germany has pledged to review possible measures should
further growth be endangered, but officials say they do not
expect such a review to be necessary.
    Bonn says the economy rebounded in the second quarter and
it predicts growth of just under two pct for the year.
    West Germany's trading partners are also likely to wait in
in vain for any further pump-priming from the Bundesbank.
    Bundesbank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger made clear
today the bank would keep interest rates down, but said there
were no plans for a cut in the Bundesbank's key discount rate,
which, at three pct, is near historical lows.
    Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl also spoke over the
weekend of the need for all countries to play a role on the
international economic scene.
    "We have to recognise that there are also limits to economic
growth in a country like Germany," he said.
    This stance was taken by Kohl when he outlined expectations
for the Venice summit in an interview last week.
    Referring to West Germany's program of tax cuts and its low
interest rates, he said, "With these policies we have made a
significant contribution to growth and to a balanced
development of the world economy."
    Kohl expected no new initiatives from Venice, though he
reckoned on confirmation of agreed policies, such as a pact
made in Paris in February which sought to stabilize the dollar.
    That pact involved a pledge from the United States and
Japan, respectively to cut the massive American budget deficit
and to stimulate Japanese demand.
    Kohl said he would remind both Washington and Tokyo of
those promises.

<title>STRIKING BRAZIL SEAMEN THREATEN MASS RESIGNATION</title>
<author>    By Stephen Powell, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    SANTOS, Brazil, March 12 - </dateline>Striking seamen said they would
offer their collective resignation rather than end their
13-day-old national strike on management's terms.
    The seamen said they were spurred to their decision after
marines occupied the ship Docemarte in Santos harbour Tuesday
night. They said seamen on the vessel were being forced to work
under duress.
    President Jose Sarney's government despatched troops to
Brazil's ports and oil installations on Tuesday.
    Seamen in Santos, Brazil's main port, are in defiant mood.
One of their leaders, Orlando dos Santos, told Reuters that
most of the 1,100 seamen in the port offered their resignations
on Wednesday. The national strike headquarters in Rio de
Janeiro said seamen were offering to resign in all the
country's main ports.
    The strike by 40,000 seamen comes as Brazil faces a serious
debt crisis brought on by a sharp deterioration in its trade
balance. The country needs all the foreign exchange it can get,
and shipowners have been quick to denounce seamen for the harm
the strike is doing to exports.
    An advertisement placed in the newspapers by the Shipowners
Association read, "The seamen's strike is illegal, irrational
and unpatriotic."
    The seamen respond that they cannot live on their present
salaries. According to officical pay lists available in the
union's office, the basic pay for ordinary seamen is 1,977
cruzados a month, while various allowances can bring their
total pay up to 4,000 cruzados a month.
    At the other end of the scale, captains earn 7,993 cruzados
a month basic pay, which is brought up to 15,229 cruzados with
allowances. 
    "Brazil's seamen are the second worst paid in the world,
after Ghana's," dos Santos said. He said the seamen had not
received a pay increase since February 1986, and prices have
doubled since then with the collapse of the government's
Cruzado Plan price freeze.
    Talks in Rio de Janeiro Wednesday involving Labour Minister
Almir Pazzionotto, seamen and employers failed to resolve the
dispute. The seamen are demanding pay raises of about 200 pct
but have been offered less than half that.

<title>ECUADOR CRUDE OIL EXPORTS STOPPED FOR FIVE MONTHS</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, March 11 - </dateline>Ecuador needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the
damage to its oil export pipeline caused by last week"s
earthquake, which will stop crude exports for five months,
energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said.
    Espinosa said yesterday the pipeline, which carries crude
from jungle fields to the Pacific Ocean coast of Balao, would
be repaired with the help of Texaco Inc <TX.N> and a Mexican
and an Argentine firm.
    President Leon Febres Cordero said two days ago that
Ecuador, an OPEC member, would have to suspend crude exports
for four months due to the quake.
    Oil traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of
Ecuador's total exports and as much as 60 pct of government
revenues.
    Deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said Ecuador
would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to
meet its needs until the line was repaired.
    The Ecuadorean minister at the Presidency, Patricio
Quevedo, told reporters that Venezuela will lend Ecuador five
mln barrels of crude, which would repaid in kind after a
180-day period.
    He added the Caracas-based Andean Development Corp had
granted a loan of 11.7 mln dlrs towards repairing the pipeline,
50 km of which had been damaged in the quake.
    In Quito, Foreign Minister Rafael Garcia Velasco yesterday
summoned ambassadors from about 40 countries to whom he issued
appeal for emergency aid for the country. Only three countries,
the U.S., Colombia and Venezuela, had offered assistance.

<title>VENEZUELA-ECUADOR OIL LOAN UNDER DISCUSSION</title>
<dateline>    CARACAS, March 17 - </dateline>Venezuela has still to work out final
details of its plan to supply Ecuador with 50,000 barrels per
day of crude oil to compensate that country for lost exports
caused by earthquake damage, a senior Petroleos de Venezuela
(PDVSA) official said.
    "We have yet to finalize details on how the compensation
will be carried out and how OPEC production quotas will be
affected," he said during the signing of a joint venture deal
with Union Pacific Corp today.
    He said an agreement was initialled on a visit last week by
Ecuador's deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite.
    He pointed out that there are some contractual points to be
considered. Venezuela, possibly unique among oil exporters,
requires its clients to sign final destination clauses to
ensure its oil is not resold on the spot market.
    Ecuador's oil minister Javier Espinosa was quoted today as
saying Venezuela will export the oil on Ecuador's account and
remit the revenues to Quito. Ecuador would pay back the oil at
a rate of 35,000 bpd.
    He said Venezuela's oil would be traded through Ecuadorean
state oil company Cepe, but the PDVSA official said the company
never allows third parties to trade its oil.

<title>LATIN, CARIBBEAN NATIONS OPPOSE TRADE BILLS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </dateline>A group of Latin American and
Caribbean nations formally opposed trade legislation pending in
Congress, saying it would curb their exports, slow development
and hinder its ability to repay foreign debt.
    Mario Rodriguez Montero, president of an Organization of
American States special committee on trade, said he was aware
of the large U.S. trade deficit, but added "the region should
not be the one affected by the trade bills."
    He said the causes of the deficit were the strong dollar
and the budget deficit, and "it is regrettable to solve it by a
trade bill that would only serve private U.S. interests."
    Rodriguez made the comment at a news conference after two
days of meetings with U.S. officials on trade bills now in
Congress that are designed to reduce the U.S. trade deficit,
which last year hit a record 166.3 billion dlrs.
    Congressional observers say the bills are aimed mainly at
Japan, Taiwan, South Korea and a few other nations with large,
annual trade surpluses with the United States.
    Mexico, Brazil and Venezuela are the only Latin nations
with large trade surpluses last year with the United States,
but even Mexico, with the largest, had a surplus of only 5.2
billion dlrs, against Japan's of 58.6 billion dlrs.
    The European Community has also opposed the bills.
    Rodriguez said the Latin and Caribbean nations backed the
Reagan Administration's opposition to many of the sections in
the legislation, including those to curb imports and to require
retaliation for foreign unfair trade practices.
    He told reporters the committee would likely mount a
campaign to fight the legislation when it comes up for debate
on the Senate floor, expected next week.
    Rodriguez said "the region needs trade to continue
development.  We hope this need will not be affected negatively
by trade legislation."
    Rodriguez said: "we need to keep the market opens -
especially the U.S. market - to obtain the necessary foreign
exchange not only to service the debt but also to continue
national development progress."
    President Reagan has said he would veto any legislation he
termed "protectionist," and his aides now are mounting a effort
to water down some of the objectionable provisions in the
legislation.
    Asked whether Reagan was ready to cast a veto, Rodriguez
said as yet "the administration is not in a veto frame of mind."

<title>AMSTERDAM LAUNCHES 300 MLN GUILDER CP PROGRAM</title>
<dateline>    AMSTERDAM, March 16 - </dateline>The city of Amsterdam launched a 300
mln guilder commercial paper program in the Dutch market, lead
manager Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank NV said.
    The issue has denominations of one mln guilders and
maturities ranging from two weeks to one year. Clearing and
delivery is through the facilities of the Dutch central bank.
    Amsterdam is the third Dutch municipality to use a
commercial paper program as credit facility. The Hague and
Rotterdam preceded with programs arranged by Algemene Bank
Nederland NV <ABNN.AS>. Details of the first tranche of the
program are still unknown.
    "At the moment, commercial paper is a cheaper form of credit
than the traditional "kasgeldleningen'," said Amsterdam's
financial alderman Walter Etty after signing the contract.
Current regulations allowed the city to acquire only half of
its short term borrowing requirement with CPs, he added.
    Kasgeldleningen or short term advances are a widely used
instrument in the Dutch market which has faced competition from
CPs since the Finance Ministry approved them in January 1986.
    "CPs and CDs are currently slightly cheaper than traditional
credit lines for promotional reasons," Amro board member Dick
Meys told journalists at the signing ceremony.
    Despite the lower cost to borrowers, the Dutch market for
commercial paper and certificates of deposits is growing only
slowly in the face of the well-developed kasgeld market and
institutional investors have hardly discovered this instrument,
Meys said.
    Foreign interest in guilder CPs and CDs is almost
non-existent due to the strong position of the guilder, but
Amro's London-based subsidiary EBC Amro Bank Ltd joined the
syndicate in case such interest emerges, Meys said.

<title>U.S. TELLS JAPAN TO DO MORE TO CUT TRADE SURPLUS</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 5 - </dateline>U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic
Affairs Allen Wallis said he had urged Japan to do much more to
reduce its large trade surplus with the United States.
    "Our central message to Japan this week was that while we
have made progress in some areas, much needs to be done," he
told a press conference after three days of talks.
    "What we need is a resolution of trade issues, we need
visible efforts to restructure the economy to encourage more
imports and we need greater domestic-led growth."
    Forecasting sluggish economic growth in Japan this year,
Wallis urged Tokyo to stimulate domestic demand to help reduce
its trade surplus, which hit a record 83 billion dlrs in 1986.
    He named several areas of particular concern to Washington
-- computer microchips, supercomputers, Kansai airport,
agricultural products and car telephones.
    He warned that the U.S./Japan agreement governing trade in
semiconductors was in jeopardy. Despite the pact, Japanese
producers are still dumping microchips in foreign markets other
than the United States while U.S. Penetration of the Japanese
market has not increased, he said.

<title>PESCH UNIT SEEKS BALANCE OF REPUBLIC HEALTH</title>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, March 5 - </dateline>Alpha Health Systems Corp, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Pesch and Co, said it submitted a
merger proposal to the board of REPH Acquisition Co, the parent
company of Republic Health Corp, which is 64 pct owned by Pesch
interests.
    The balance of REPH's common stock is owned by members of
Republic management, McDonnell Douglas Corp <MD>, Donaldson,
Lufkin and Jenrette and Pacific Asset Holdings L.P.
    Republic currently owns 44 hospitals and manages 46 other
facilities, in 25 states.
    Details of the proposal were not disclosed.  Company
representatives were not immediately available.
    The proposal provides that REPH would become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Alpha and that the existing REPH common
stockholders would become stockholders of Alpha, it said.
    REPH's board has appointed a special committee to negotiate
terms of the proposed merger, Pesch said.
    Last year, Republic was acquired by REPH in a leveraged
buyout transaction led by Dr. LeRoy Pesch, the principal
shareholder of Pesch and Co.
    Alpha recently submitted a second offer to acquire the
stock of American Medical International Inc (AMI) at 22 dlrs a
share in cash and securities, which is still being considered
by American Medical's board, Pesch said.

said its Hyland Therapeutics unit has started the first human
clinical trials on genetically engineered Factor VIII, the
clotting agent missing from the blood of most hemophiliacs.
    It said unlike Factor VIII concentrates currently in use,
genetically engineered Factor VIII would not be limited by the
availability of human plasma and will be completely free from
blood-borne viruses, including AIDS and all forms of hepatitis,
Baxter said.
    Baxter also said it is in the final states of U.S. clinical
trials on a highly purified form of Factor VIII derived from
human plasma that is produced using an advanced process
incorporating monoclonal antibody purification.
    It said Genetics Institute, a publicly held biotechnology
company in which Baxter is a shareholder, will supply the
protein used for human clinical testing, as well as a
substantial portion of ongoing production requirements.

<title>INDIA COOL TO LIMITED U.S. SUPERCOMPUTER OFFER</title>
<dateline>    NEW DELHI, March 27 - </dateline>Indian officials responded coolly  to
a reported U.S. Offer to sell India a supercomputer less
powerful than it sought, saying it showed Washington's lack of
sensitivity to Indian concerns.
    Asked about a New York Times report that the United States
had offered New Delhi a supercomputer generations behind the
type it requested, an official told Reuters, "If the U.S. is
doing that they have not been sensitive to Indian concerns."
    He declined to confirm the report directly but said India
had received an offer of a supercomputer from the United States
"and we are considering it."
    Sounding disappointed and dismayed he added, "We do not wish
at this stage to say whether it is the computer we were looking
for, or a more or less powerful model."
    The official, who asked to remain anonymous, added: "An
announcement will be made in 10 days to two weeks time."
    India has sought for more than two years to buy an advanced
supercomputer primarily for monsoon forecasting. But the sale
has been held up by U.S. Security concerns prompted by India's
closeness to the Soviet Union, its chief arms supplier.

<title>WORLD BANK PRESIDENT OPPOSES DEBT FORGIVENESS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 13 - </dateline>World Bank President Barber Conable
said he opposed forgiving developing countries' debt because
the proposal, if adopted, would lead to a cutoff in lending to
the indebted countries.
    "I think (debt) forgiveness will simply create an
environment in which no more money will go into development and
a lot of the world will be consigned to poverty and to
instability indefinitely," he told ABC Television on Sunday.
    A number of bills have been introduced in Congress that
would require commercial banks to forgive a least a portion of
the debt owed them by cash-starved developing countries.
    "I think we've got to find ways of encouraging continuous
improvement in policies, of wise use of money in short, rather
than trying to turn everybody off," Conable said.
    Conable told ABC's "Business World" he supported Treasury
Secretary James Baker's debt plan as an "andidote to debt."
    Baker has said the best way to reduce the developing
countries' debt burden is to boost their growth rates through
reformed domestic policies and increased commercial bank
lending.

<dateline>    KUWAIT, March 24 - </dateline>Kuwaiti oil minister Sheikh Ali
al-Khalifa al-Sabah said OPEC was producing well below its oil
output ceiling and this would help prices move higher,
according to a Kuwaiti newspaper interview.
    The al-Rai al-Aam newspaper quoted him as saying OPEC was
pumping 2.4 mln barrels per day (bpd) less than its 15.8 mln
bpd ceiling, while consumers were drawing down their petroleum
stocks at a rate of 4.5 mln bpd.
    As long as OPEC maintains its output curbs, demand for its
oil will rise in April and May, Sheikh Ali said, adding that
Kuwait was strongly committed to its OPEC quota.

<title>U.K. GROWING IMPATIENT WITH JAPAN - THATCHER</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 26 - </dateline>Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said
the U.K. Was growing more impatient with Japanese trade
barriers and warned that it would soon have new powers against
countries not offering reciprocal access to their markets.
    She told Parliament that the bid by the U.K.'s Cable and
Wireless Plc <CAWL.L> to enter the Japanese telecommunications
market was being regarded by her government as a test case.
    "I wrote to the prime minister of Japan, Mr Nakasone, on the
fourth of March to express our interest on the Cable and
Wireless bid. I have not yet had a reply. We see this as a test
on how open the Japanese market really is," Thatcher said.
    Thatcher told Parliament that "shortly ... We shall have
more powers than we have now, when, for example the powers
under the Financial Services Act and the Banking Act become
available, then we shall be able to take action in cases where
other countries do not offer the same full access to financial
services as we do."
    Cable and Wireless is seeking a stake in the proposed
Japanese telecommunications rival to Kokusai Denshin Denwa.
    But the Japanese minister for post and telecommunications
was reported as saying that he opposed Cable and Wireless
having a managerial role in the new company.

<title>HARPER <HPR> GETS BID FROM HARCOURT <HBJ></title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 11 - </dateline>Harper and Row Publishers Inc said it
received an acquisition offer from Harcourt Brace Jovanovich
INc to acquire all of Harper and Row's shares at 50 dlrs a
share in cash.
    Harper said it will consider the proposal, including such
possible concerns as anti-trust and other legal considerations.
    On Monday, Harper and Row received a surprise 34 dlr-a-
share bid from investor Theodore Cross, owner of six pct of the
shares, for the stock he does not own.
     Harcourt made clear in its offer that it will step aside
if Harper's directors and shareholders reject the bid, Harper
said.
    Harper said the board has previously expressed a strong
determination to remain an independent publishing enterprise.
    Harper also said that New World Pictures, a shareholder,
has requested a copy of Harper's shareholder list to be used in
soliciting proxies.
    New World has 30,800 shares of the total 4.4 mln shares.
    Harper and Row's stock closed off 3/4 to 33-1/2 after
rising 9-1/4 points yesterday.
    Shareholders are due to vote April 2 on a shareholders
rights plan designed to thwart hostile takeovers.
    Ivan Obolensky, an analyst with the investment banking for
of Sterling Grace and Co said Harper and Row is one of the few
remaining independent publishers with a "back list" of authors
stretching back 200 years.
    He said as long as the company maintains copyrights with
the estates of deceased authors, it controls all motion picture
and television rights to the stories. And he said new printing
technologies make new editions a profitable business.
    "Harcourt Brace needs a back list of that nature and is
willing to pay up for it," Obolensky said. But he said Harper
and Row "has plenty of beef to warrant a 50 dlr bid.

<title>JAPAN ISOLATED, YEN RISES, WORLD FEELS CHEATED</title>
<author>    By Eric Hall, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 30 - </dateline>Japan is becoming dangerously isolated
again as the U.S. And Europe feel they have been cheated by
Japanese promises to switch from export to domestic-led growth,
officials and businessmen from around the world said.
    As the dollar today slipped to a record low below 145 yen,
making Japanese exporters and holders of dollar investments
grit their teeth harder, Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said
there was a perception Japan had reneged on its promise.
    The problem goes deep and centres on misunderstandings by
both sides over the key Maekawa report of April, last year.
    The document was prepared by a private committee formed by
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and led by former Bank of
Japan head Haruo Maekawa. It recommended that to stop friction
due to its large trade surpluses, Japan must "make a historical
transformation in its traditional policies on economic
management and the nation's lifestyle. There can be no further
development for Japan without this transformation."
    Americans and Europeans took the report to heart and have
looked in vain for clear signs of this historic change. But the
Japanese remain doubtful about the short, or even medium term
prospects of totally transforming their economic habits.
    The bubble of frustration against what appears as Japanese
prevarication burst last week. The U.S. Said it intended to
raise tariffs of as much as 300 mln dlrs on Japanese exports to
the U.S. On the grounds Japan had abrogated a bilateral
semiconductor pact.
    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher threatened to
block Japanese financial firms from London after the Japanese
placed what the British say are restrictive conditions on a bid
by British firm Cable and Wireless to join a domestic
telecommunications joint venture.
    On Friday, European currency dealers said European central
banks, annoyed at restrictive Japanese trade practises, might
leave Japan alone to intervene to staunch the rise of the yen.
    Eishiro Saito, head of top Japanese business group
Keidanren, spotted the dangers inherent in such contradictory
views last November when he visited the European Community.
"Related to this matter of (trade) imbalance, the point that I
found to be of great cause for alarm during this trip to Europe
was the excessive degree of hope placed by the Europeans in the
results of the Maekawa report," he said.
    "We explained that the process of restructuring the economy
away from its dependence on exports toward a balance between
domestic and external demand...Would take time," Saito said.
    Saito's words were ignored. In February, EC Industrial
Policy Director Heinrich von Moltke came to Japan and said "I
only know that your government, under the leadership of
Maekawa, points to restructuring your economy into a less
outward looking, more inward looking one. It is the Maekawa
report which has attracted the most attention in Europe."
    And Europeans and Americans want quick action. "A far better
answer than protectionism would be structural change within the
Japanese economy, the kind suggested by the Maekawa report. And
we hope to see changes occur in the near future," visiting
Chairman of General Motors Roger Smith said in March.
    Such expectations are now ingrained, which was partly the
fault of Nakasone, who heralded Maekawa's report as a sea of
change in Japanese affairs, said U.S. Officials.
    Months before the report was issued, U.S. And EC business
leaders met their Japanese colleagues to discuss the trade
problem.
    "We are more anxious than ever that the new approach of the
Maekawa committee does lead to speedy and effective action,"
said EC Industrial Union leader Lord Ray Pennock.
    "The important implication of the Maekawa report is that it
is finally looking to let Japanese enjoy the fruits of their
labour," said Philip Caldwell, Senior Managing Director of
Shearson Lehman Brothers.
    Contents of the report were leaded well ahead of issuance.
    Japanese officials say they are implementing the report as
fast as they can, said a European ambassador who has travelled
the country asking about this issue.
    He said People mentioned many things in line with the
spirit of the report, including restructuring of the coal and
steel industries.
    A major misunderstanding is that the private report was
government policy. Europeans are confused about this,
underlined by von Moltke's reference to the "leadership" of the
Maekawa report. Even so, Japanese officials point to last
September's government programme of new economic measures.
"Without endorsing the report as policy, officials point out
that the government has put its signature to a programme
designed to implement the report," the ambassador said.

<title>PANAMA CANAL OFFICIAL CONFIRMS NO 1988 TOLL RISE</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 19 - </dateline>Panama Canal toll charges will not rise
in the year to end-September 1988, despite last October's
landslide which dumped 0.5 mln cubic yards of debris into the
waterway, Canal Commission Administrator Dennis McAuliffe said.
    He told a press conference that in confirming the
Commission's earlier announcement of unchanged tolls for 1988,
he was not necessarily implying there would be a rise in 1989.
    The canal would probably make a five to six mln dlr loss in
the current financial year but this could be carried over and
met from next year's revenues.
    This year's deficit resulted from the landslide which cost
the canal about 15 mln dlrs, McAuliffe said. This included
eight to nine mln dlrs in immediate costs with the rest being
spent on earth-moving operations to prevent any further
landslides.
    He said the landslide was not caused by deforestation and
he described as grossly exaggerated reports that there was any
threat to the canal's water supply in the foreseeable future.
    Studies concerning the possibility of widening the Gaillard
cut would not be affected by the landslide, he said, adding
that he expected the canal board to determine whether and when
the canal needed widening by January 1988 at the latest.

<title>SWISS WARY OF U.S.-BRITISH BANK SUPERVISION PACT</title>
<dateline>    ZURICH, March 13 - </dateline>Markus Lusser, vice-president of the
Swiss National Bank, said he was sceptical of the recent
U.S.-British accord on joint bank supervision, fearing smaller
countries could be forced to cooperate.
    In a speech prepared for delivery to a meeting of West
German savings banks, he said such an accord would cover the
three most important financial centres of the world if extended
to Japan as planned.
    "Countries not prepared to cooperate with an agreement of
the group of three could easily be put under pressure," Lusser
said.
    "It would be enough to forbid banks the right to make use of
those financial markets or to place them under a special
status," he added.
    Banks which operate worldwide could scarcely afford to stay
away from these centres and would place their national
governments under pressure to conform.
    Lusser added that he was opposed to the form, though not
the content of the accord. Switzerland itself was not affected,
since capital adequacy requirements here were already stricter
than in Britain or the United States. But he feared such
accords might be substituted for internationally negotiated
pacts.

<title>CANADIAN PACIFIC (CP) CONFIRMS EARNINGS</title>
<dateline>    MONTREAL, March 9 - </dateline>Canadian Pacific Ltd said fourth
quarter 1986 operating profit rose to 91.6 mln dlrs, or 30 cts
a share, from 50.7 mln dlrs, or 20 cts a share, a year ago.
    The statement confirmed released preliminary earnings
figures the company released in February.
    A 102.6 mln dlr gain on the sale of CP's Cominco Ltd
interest helped raise final 1986 fourth quarter profit to 193.8
mln dlrs or 65 cts a share.
    The company said a drop in 1986 full-year operating profit
to 150.1 mln dlrs from a restated 252.7 mln dlrs in 1985 was
due mainly to lower world oil prices.
    The company said its CP Rail division reported 1986 net
income of 119.4 mln dlrs, compared with 133.4 mln dlrs in 1985.
It said grain traffic recovered from drought-affected levels of
a year ago but was offset by weakness in other traffic areas
and increased expenses.
    It said the net loss from its Soo Line increased to 33.5
mln dlrs loss from 8.7 mln dlrs loss in 1985, mainly due to
restructuring charges.
    Canadian Pacific said favorable developments during the
year included reduced bulk shipping losses as a result of a
recovery in tanker markets and a turnaround in the forest
products sector.

<dateline>    BONN, March 17 - </dateline>Production of a four-megabit superchip,
developed jointly by Siemens AG <SIEG.F> and NV Philips
Gloeilampenfabrieken <PGLO.AS>, could start by late 1988 or
early 1989, West German Technology Minister Heinz Riesenhuber
told a news conference.
    "We have caught up (with) our competitors," a Technology
Ministry spokeswoman said. "Now it's a question of who will be
first to produce it, and we are in with a good chance."
    Companies in the United States and Japan say they already
have a prototype but have not yet reached the production stage.
    Siemens and Philips, together with the West German and
Dutch governments, have invested a total of 1.4 billion marks
in researching and developing the chip.
    Representatives of the two companies said the sophisticated
technology could be used to produce cheaper medical diagnosis
instruments and to regulate car fuel consumption and emissions.

<title>JAPANESE ECONOMIC PACKAGE SEEN AS MAJOR CHANGE</title>
<author>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 8 - </dateline>The economic package unveiled yesterday by
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) marks the start of a
major shift away from the policies of the past, private
economists and government officials said.
    "A big step forward has been taken," said Industrial Bank of
Japan Ltd senior economist Susumu Taketomi.
    The package, seen as a response to mounting overseas
pressure to boost the sagging Japanese economy, calls for a
supplementary budget of more than 5,000 billion yen later this
year, plus increased imports.
    Although the measures must still gain the approval of the
Finance Ministry, economists said the government will find it
too difficult to alter the measures significantly once they
have gained domestic and overseas backing.
    "At last, the LDP and the Ministry of Finance are turning a
corner," said Sumitomo Bank Ltd's chief economist Masahiko
Koido.
    For the past five years the government has adhered to a
tight fiscal policy in its drive to stop issuing deficit
financing bonds in 1990.
    To meet that goal, spending departments are required to
submit annual budgets for current expenditure 10 pct below the
previous year and investment five pct below.
    Masayoshi Ito, chairman of the LDP's policy affairs
council, said yesterday the government must stick to its 1990
fiscal reform target, but should review the ceiling it places
on public works spending.
    Even some Finance Ministry officials privately acknowledge
that policy changes might be needed, including easing the
government's iron grip on spending.
    Economists said the government could meet its 1990 target
and also increase spending by using money it got from the sale
of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp shares and by taking
advantage of lower than expected interest rates on its debt.
Officially, the Finance Ministry is adhering to its tight
stance but some signs of change have appeared.
    "We do not have any intention of abandoning our objective to
restore fiscal balance," a Finance Ministry spokesman said.
    He said so far the ministry had tried to achieve two goals
simultaneously. These were reforming the government's fiscal
position and stimulating domestic demand.
    But the Finance Ministry spokesman added, "In looking at the
current situation of the economy and the relationship between
Japan and the United States, we feel we have to place more
emphasis on stimulating demand."
    Economists predict battles within the government over the
coming months as the Finance Ministry fights to ensure the
cracks in its policy do not lead to a complete breakdown of
fiscal discipline.
    "The Ministry is afraid that once there is a small hole in
the dike, it will lead to a flood," Industrial Bank's Taketomi
said.
    But Taketomi said the ministry, provided it has a device in
place to check excess spending for political reasons, is likely
to give the go-ahead to a shift in policy.
    "This seems to mark the first step toward a more active
fiscal policy in response to requests from the international
community," he said.
    Sumitomo's Koido said if the government quickly implements
the LDP's 5,000 billion yen package, economic growth in the
1987/88 year ending next March 31 could be around three pct,
His current forecast of 2.2 pct growth assumes a supplementary
budget of around 1,000 billion yen.

<dateline>    BRUSSELS, April 2 - </dateline>The European Community (EC) is to boost
spending to help the jobless this year.
    The EC's executive commission said in a statement spending
on its so-called social fund would rise to 3.1 billion European
Currency Units from 2.5 billion ECUs in 1986. The fund is
designed to help boost job creation and improve worker
mobility, and supplement national schemes in the EC's 12 member
states.
    Another 60 mln ECUs could be added if EC ministers switch
unused project credits to other programs, the Commission said.
    Italy is the largest net beneficiary in 1987, getting 635
mln ECUs, with Britain in second place with 580 mln.

<title>PARIBAS SEEKING TO ADJUST ECUADOR OIL FACILITY</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 16 - </dateline>Banque Paribas, which arranged a 220
mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports,
wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the country
recover from a devastating earthquake, bankers said.
    But the French bank's plan, which would effectively
postpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several
months, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52
members of the loan syndicate.
    The pipeline that carries all Ecuador's oil exports was
ruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take some five months
to repair at a cost of about 150 mln dlrs to repair.
    President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total
damages caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that
Ecuador as a result would maintain January's suspension of
interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt.
    Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the
price of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador's
export earnings and 60 pct of government revenue.
    Although sympathetic to Ecuador's plight, many banks in the
Paribas facility feel that emergency financial relief is a job
for international financial organizations and not for
commercial banks, bankers said.
    The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed last
October 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a
Latin American nation since the region's debt crisis erupted in
August 1982.
    Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel strongly
that the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, they
fear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditions
for Latin borrowers will be set back.
    "There's a lot of reluctance by the other banks. They feel
it's a different facility, and so any kind of suggestion of a
restructuring would look bad," one banker commented.

<title>ECUADOR MINISTER RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT DEBT</title>
<dateline>    Quito, march 11 - </dateline>ecuador is considering measures for
dealing with its foreign debt following the earthquake that
killed 300 people, left 4,000 homeless and cost the country
close to a billion dollars, information minister marco lara
told reuters.
    "the government's position ... is to honour the (debt)
commitments, but without sacrificing the country, because first
we have to survive and later we can comply," lara said.
    He said the nation would later announce plans to deal with
the country's 8.16-billion-dlr foreign debt.
    The government has estimated the economic cost of the
earthquake last thursday night at nearly one billion dlrs,
including oil revenues lost because an oil pipeline was
damaged.
     The president of the ecuadorean Red Cross, hugo merino,
told reuters the official toll of 300 dead and 4,000 missing
could rise as rescue workers inspect stricken sites from
helicopters and wade through mud to reach victims in the four
northeastern provinces hardest hit.

    Origins and manufacturers were inactive, traders added.
    Cocoa for May delivery was off nine dlrs at 1,925 dlrs a

<title>FINNS AND CANADIANS TO STUDY MTBE PRODUCTION PLANT</title>
<dateline>    HELSINKI, April 8 - </dateline>Finland's national oil company Neste Oy
<NEOY.HE> said in a statement it had agreed with Canadian firms
to study the feasibility of building a plant in Edmonton,
Canada, to produce a replacement for lead in petrol.
    The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mln
Canadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether
(MTBE) from raw materials available locally, it said.
    The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese Canada
Inc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe Line
Company Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C.
    The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materials
availability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and the
important capital and operating advantages gained by locating
on an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said.
    The partners would look into the feasibility of a plant
producing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancer
that can replace tetra ethyl lead.
    Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United States
where lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because of
health concerns, the statement added.
    Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as the
U.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination in
Canada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE,
it said.
    Finland's Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over five
billion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has a
major investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia.
    The Edmonton, Alberta plant would be scheduled to go on
stream in late 1989, the statement said.

<dateline>    SEOUL, March 27 - </dateline>Shares of about 1,700 firms are expected
to be traded in South Korea's first over-the-counter market due
to open next month, finance ministry officials said.
    Companies which have been operating for more than two years
with paid-in capital of 200 mln won or more will be allowed to
join the market, they said citing a guideline prepared by the
ministry.
    Firms using venture capital can take part in the market

small companies diversify their fund-raising sources.
    The guideline requires companies wishing to take part in
the market to register with the National Securities
Association. Shares of registered firms will be traded through
securities firms.
    Companies with paid-in capital of 500 mln won or more can
be listed on the Korea Stock Exchange three years after they
are established, the officials said.
    At the end of 1986, 355 companies were listed on the
exchange.

<title>ROSTENKOWSKI SAYS REAGAN MUST RECONSIDER TAX RISE</title>
<dateline>     WASHINGTON, March 26 - </dateline>Chairman Dan Rostenkowski of the
tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee said today President
Reagan must reconsider his consistent opposition to any tax
increases.
    The Illinois Democrat, asked on a television interview (on
NBC-Today) about the possibility of tax hikes, said, "I think
the president is going to have to reconsider."
    He added, "I just hope there's enough vision in this
administration to recognize that our deficits are intolerable
and the only way we're going to do it is by raising revenues."

<title>INDIAN BANKER SAYS RATES CUT AFFECTS PROFITABILITY</title>
<dateline>    BOMBAY, April 27 - </dateline>The cut in the lending rates and other
changes made in the interest rates will hit the profitability
of many commercial banks in India, Indian Banks' Association
chairman M. N. Goiporia told a bankers' conference.
    The changes were announced by the Reserve Bank of India on
March 31 and became effective on April 1.
    "Some of the latest credit policy measures such as reduced
lending rates, raising the statutory liquidity ratio and
restructuring of deposit rates will pose a potential threat to
commercial banks' continuing higher profitability levels," he
said.
    Goiporia said most foreign and Indian commercial banks
including those owned by the government have been making
profits over the years, mainly due to better fund management
and the enlargement of the banks' capital base. He did not
elaborate.
    The Reserve Bank's new credit policy for commercial banks
cut the maximum lending rate by one pct to 16.5 pct, raised
rates on deposits of two years by a half pct to nine pct and by
one pct to 10 pct on deposits of more than two years. To cut
excess liquidity in the industry, the Reserve Bank raised the
banks' liquidity ratio by a half pct to 37.5 pct, immobilising
nearly five billion rupees of deposits, bankers said.

<dateline>    TORONTO, March 23 - </dateline><Costain Ltd>'s shareholders will be
asked at the April 16 annual meeting to approve a change in the
company's name to Coscan Development Ltd, the company said in
the annual report.
    Under terms of the 1984 sale of controlling interest in the
company to <Carena-Bancorp Inc> from Costain Group Plc, the
Costain name was to be changed.
    Costain said a settlement was reached with the Costain
Group concerning a legal action launched before shareholders at
the 1986 annual meeting approved in principle changing the
company's name to Costan. The Costan name was not implemented.
    Costain also said in the annual report that it should
report further growth in earnings due to increased level of
activity in 1987 and expectation of improved margins.
    It said it expects housing revenue will increase by 25 pct
in 1987, supported by an increased number of active projects
and a carry forward of 427 sales. Costain reported housing
revenue in 1986 of 229.6 mln dlrs, up from 159.2 mln dlrs in
1985.
    Costain previously reported 1986 earnings of 12.9 mln dlrs
or 93 cts a share, compared to 6.9 mln dlrs or 63 cts a share
in the prior year.

have returned to work this week after ratifying a contract.
    A company spokesman said members of Local Two of the
Bakery, Confectionery and Tobacco Workers, who had walked out
May 10, reached "mutually agreeable terms" in a new two-year
contract.
    Meanwhile, about 100 Teamster drivers and warehouse
employees, whose contract expired May 16, remained out, the
company said. No new talks were scheduled, Sara Lee said.
    Details of the new contract were not immediately available,
but a company spokesman said it "maintained benefits and called
for no sacrifices from current employees."
    Union sources reported that the contract freezes wages and
introduces a sharply lower starting rate for new hires. They
said it also gives Sara Lee concessions on a workplace issue
involving excused absences.

<title>ECUADOR SAYS WILL RESUME LIMITED OIL PRODUCTION</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, April 13 - </dateline>Ecuador will resume limited crude output
next week to fill up storage tanks as a first step to pump oil
to a Colombian pipeline on May one, the state Ecuadorean
Petroleum Corp (CEPE) said.
    CEPE manager Carlos Romoleroux told reporters that Ecuador
would begin pumping an unspecified amount of crude in
northeastern jungle oilfields at the end of next week in
preparation to send the oil through a new pipeline link-up to
neighbouring Colombia.
    Oil production in Ecuador was halted on March five when an
earthquake damaged the country's main pipeline from Lago Agrio,
at the heart of the Ecuadorean jungle oilfields, to the pacific
port of Balao.
    It will take at least until the end of July to repair the
pipeline and return output to normal levels. The country was
pumping between 245,000 bpd and 250,000 bpd before the tremor.
    To resume limited output in the meantime, Ecuador is
constructing a 26 mile pipeline linkup, capable of carrying
55,000 bpd, from Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon, the starting point
of Colombia's pipeline to the Pacific port of Tumaco.
    The original target date to resume limited crude output was
May eight, the scheduled date for the inauguration of the Lago
Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline, an energy ministry spokesman
said.

<NOR>.
    Under Connecticut banking law, New England based bank
holding companies such as Fleet are not allowed to operate
Connecticut banks if they merge with companies from outside the
region.  Norstar is based in Albany, N.Y.
    First Connecticut has assets of about two billion dlrs. 
Fleet has total assets of about 21 billion dlrs.
    Fleet said it will seek to have the Connecticut law amended
to allow it to retain First Connecticut, which is based in
Hartford.
    Fleet's acquisition of Norstar is now expected to be
completed around July 1, 1988, when a change in laws in Fleet's
home state of Rhode Island allowing interstate banking outside
New England will go into effect.

<title>UNION PACIFIC <UNP> TO SELL PART OF REFINERY</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </dateline>Union Pacific Corp said it will sign a
pact in Caracas on March 17 with Petroleos De Venezuela, PDVSA,
to sell the state owned company half of its Corpus Christi,
Texas refinery owned by its Union Pacific's Champlin Petroleum
Co subsidiary.
    The sale will also include the related marketing and
distribution system for the refinery's products.
    A spokesman for the company said that a statement may be
issued later today giving details of the transaction.
    There was no immediate comment from PDVSA officials in New
York.
    The Corpus Christi refinery has a capacity of about 160,000
barrels per day, the Union Pacific spokesman said, and is a
largely upgraded facility but he would place no value on the
transaction.
    The additional acquisition of refinery and distribution
assets by PDVSA has been expected as Venezuela has been moving
aggressively to enhance its role in the oil industry from
producer to excpanding its presence in the downstream sector.
    Purchase of part of Champlin's operations also fits a
profile which PDVSA officials have said previously they looked
for in any acquisition.
    One PDVSA official said the company was looking for
independent oil companies with good refinery and distribution
network and a strong regional presence.
    The potential purchase of the interest in Champlin followed
its earlier acquisition of a part interest in Southland Corp's
<SLC> Citgo Petroleum Corp subsidiary.
    In that agreement signed September 15, 1986, PDVSA paid
Southland 290 mln dlrs for half of Citgo's stock.
    The potetnital acquisition of half Champlin's Corpus
Christi plant will also give Venezuela an additional outlet for
its crude oil production while giving the refiner an assured
source of supply, trade sources said.
    In the earlier deal with Southland, PDVSA agredd to to
supply Citgo with at least 130,000 bpd of crude oil and other
feedstocks.

<dateline>    PARIS, March 23 - </dateline>French industrial production fell a
seasonally adjusted 1.98 pct in January after revised unchanged
output in December, the National Statistics Institute (INSEE)
said.
    The figure, which excludes construction and public works,
put the January index, base 1980, at 99 after 101 in December.
January output was 1.98 pct down on January 1986.
    INSEE, which from January changed its base year to 1980
from 1970, originally had December output down 2.2 pct on
November, using the old base year.
    INSEE said production in January was affected by rail
strikes and severely cold weather.
    It said output of gas and electricity was very high but
activity slowed on construction sites, in quarries and in
certain base industries.

<title>SOY PLANTS MIGHT BE USED TO DRAW CADMIUM FROM SOIL</title>
<dateline>    ROTTERDAM, April 27 - </dateline>Effective extraction of the toxic
metal cadmium from soil may at last be feasible using soybean
plants, research in the Netherlands by a Belgian-based
environment group shows.
    Cadmium, naturally drawn up by plants and passed on to
consumers, has been shown to produce kidney damage and
resulting calcium loss as well as causing high blood pressure
and cancers, a spokesman for the Ecological Life and
Cultivation (VELT) said.
    Three years of experiments by the organization showed
soybean plants extracted up to 16 pct of soil-borne cadmium,
which went into the leaves and not into the beans themselves.
    Cadmium is present in the soil because of emissions in the
past by factories producing non-ferrous metals, the spokesman
said.
    "Although many of these factories are now using far safer
methods of manufacture, the cadmium is already in the soil and
until now there has been no way to get rid of it," he said.

<dateline>    TEL AVIV, April 1 - </dateline>Israel's Ambassador to Washington said
Israel and the Soviet Union have agreed to exchange visits by
delegations in a move each hoped would lead to a renewal of

    Ambassador Meir Rosenne told Israel Radio: "A Soviet
delegation will come to Israel and an Israeli delegation to the
Soviet Union, there is no doubt about that."
    Rosenne said both countries had an interest in restoring
ties severed by Moscow during the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.

<title>EC APPROVES 680 MLN STG U.K. AID TO ROVER GROUP</title>
<dateline>    BRUSSELS, March 19 - </dateline>The European Community (EC) Commission
said it approved a 680 mln stg British government aid package
to state-owned Rover Group Plc <BLLL.L> to restructure and
privatise the group's bus and truck subsidiaries.
    In a statement, the commission said Rover's <Leyland
Trucks> subsidiary would be financially and physically
restructured following a recently announced merger between
Leyland Trucks and <DAF> of the Netherlands.
    The Commission said government aid for this program was
justified because it would contribute to Europe-wide
rationalisation of the truck sector.
    The amount of aid approved is slightly below the 750 mln
stg the British government had planned to grant Rover by
writing off accumulated losses and other costs.
    The Commission said there was overcapacity in the European
truck industry estimated at between 25 and 40 pct.
    It said its approval of the aid also took into account the
consequences for jobs and for the regions affected by the
restructuring.
    Under EC rules, the Commission has to approve all
government aid to industry.

<title>AUSTRALIA ATTACKS U.S. GATT FARM RULES EXEMPTION</title>
<dateline>    GENEVA, March 5 - </dateline>Australia accused the U.S. of increasing
protectionism on agricultural products and called for an end to
Washington's special 32-year exemption from certain GATT rules
on agricultural trade.
    Robert Arnott, Australia's delegate to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), made the appeal at a
special annual meeting which reviews the 1955 U.S. waiver.
    "Australia today said the United States' goals of reducing
U.S. barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted by
actions which in fact increased protection in trade in
agriculture," the Australian delegation said in a statement.
    "The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basic
flaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture," Arnott told the
meeting.
    Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as a
justification for "dubious protective measures" by the U.S. He
listed a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps to
close the U.S. sugar market to imports.
    He also told Reuters the waiver allowed Washington to
impose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domestic
support programs. This covered imports of dairy products,
peanuts, cotton and sugar.
    Asked to comment, Michael Samuels, U.S. ambassador to the
GATT, told Reuters: "These charges have been made since the very
beginning. The waiver is part of domestic U.S. agricultural
policy, part of our law when we joined the GATT".
    "We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during the
Uruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same with
their programs. We can negotiate them all," Samuels added.
    Ninety-two nations are taking part in the four-year Uruguay
round of talks launched in Punta del Este last September.
Bargaining in agricultural goods and services (banking,
tourism, insurance) is included for the first time as well as
manufactured goods.

<title>IMF, DEVELOPMENT BANKS, TO ASSIST ECUADOR</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </dateline>It could be months before major
assistance is provided for Earthquake-stricken Ecuador,
although the International Monetary Fund and the development
banks have already taken the first steps, monetary sources and
U.S. officials said.
    They said the IMF had informed the Ecuadorean government
that it was prepared, under its emergency system, to provide
about 50 mln dlrs, or about 25 per cent of the country's quota
in the agency, but it is up to Ecuador to request the money.
    At the same time, the World Bank and the Inter-American
Development Bank have dispatched missions to the region hit by
last Thursday's quake to determine what the country's needs are
and how they can speed up disbursement of funds from programs
already approved.
    The World Bank estimates that of the over one billion dlrs
it has approved for Ecuador in recent years, some 277 mln dlrs
has yet to be disbursed and a portion of this could,
potentially, be made available.
    The bank said that the programs it has approved are for
rural development, agriculture, water and sewerage, electrical
power and others.
    If the assistance that is needed can be fit into these
general categories, the funds could be then provided for from
expedited disbursements

<title>BELGIAN BOURSE TAX MOVE BLOCKED IN CABINET</title>
<dateline>    BRUSSELS, April 3 - </dateline>Finance Ministry proposals for
abolishing bourse transaction taxes for non-residents have been
blocked in cabinet and will not be re-submitted for several
weeks, a Finance Ministry spokesman said.
    Government sources said the blockage would also delay an
announcement of measures that would simplify the procedure for
non-residents to recoup the 25 pct withholding tax levied on
investment income in Belgium.
    Finance Minister Mark Eyskens told Reuters yesterday that
he hoped the cabinet would approve the bourse transaction tax
proposals today.
    Eyskens also said he would in the next few days announce
plans to simplify and eventually stop the procedure for foreign
investors to reclaim witholding tax.
    Financial analysts said the current procedure is so slow
that it effectively acts as a barrier to foreign investment in
Belgium, especially in the bond market.
    They said the move to simplify it would be far more
significant than the abolition for non-residents of the bourse
transaction taxes. These are set at three rates -- 0.07 pct,
0.14 pct and 0.35 pct -- according to the security transacted.
    Government sources said abolition of the bourse taxes for
foreign investors had been held up by concern in the cabinet
over the budgetary impact of the move, put by the ministry
spokesman at 125 mln francs a year.
    The sources said it was likely that this proposal and plans
to simplify the witholding tax procedure would now be submitted
together to the cabinet in several weeks.
    Eyskens said abolition of the transaction taxes for
non-residents would make Brussels one of the few stock
exchanges in the world where foreign investors were not
subjected to such a tax.

<dateline>    QUITO, March 11 - </dateline>Ecuador, stricken by a severe earthquake,
will honour its 8.16 billion dlr foreign debt but only after
ensuring the survival of the country after the tremor which
claimed at least 300 lives and caused 4,000 persons to
disappear.
    "The government's position ... is to permit us to honour the
(debt) commitments but without sacrificing the country, because
first we have to survive and later we can comply," information
minister Marco Lara told reuters.
     He said the nation would later announce definitive

which the government said will cause nearly a billion dlrs in
economic losses.

<title>UN CONFERENCE FORMALLY ADOPTS NEW RUBBER PACT</title>
<dateline>    GENEVA, March 20 - </dateline>A new International Natural Rubber
Agreement, INRA, was formally adopted by a United Nations
Conference today.
    The new accord is due to replace the current one, which
expires in October.
    Conference chairman Manaspas Xuto of Thailand said the
formal adoption represented "a historic moment."
    The latest round of talks, which began March 9, represented
the fourth attempt to negotiate a new INRA in nearly two years.
Xuto described the negotiations as "by no means easy, and we
often faced problems."
    The new pact is due to enter into force provisionally when
ratified by countries accounting for 75 pct of world net
exports and 75 pct of net imports.
    The new INRA will enter into force definitively when
governments accounting for at least 80 pct of net exports and
80 pct of net imports have ratified it.
    It will be open for signature from May 1 to December 31
this year.
    It is expected that provisional entry into force will take
at least 12 to 14 months from now, delegates said.
    During the hiatus between the two agreements buffer stock
operations will be suspended, but the International Natural
Rubber Council will remain in place.
    Xuto told the conference both the 1979 agreement and its
successor were aimed at meeting the needs of producers and
consumers of natural rubber over the long term.
    Both had interest in stabilising prices and supplies, Xuto
added. He also praised "the spirit of 'give' and 'take' that
prevailed throughout this session."
    Ahmed Farouk of Malaysia, speaking on behalf of producers,
said the conclusion of the new pact showed that the mutuality
of interests between producers and consumers is now as valid as
it was when negotiations of the first agreement began in the
1970s.
    Farouk said the ability to manage inventories on the basis
of predictable stable prices is "a vital consideration for
multinational tire companies, whether or not consuming
countries as a whole claimed to be no longer so seriously
concerned about security of the rubber supply."
    He said producers considered that the 1979 agreement had
served the purpose for which it was created.
    Farouk urged consuming countries to promote early accession
to the new pact "to avoid an undue gap between the old and the
new.
    Gerard Guillonneau of France, speaking for consumers,
agreed that the 1979 agreement had worked relatively well.
    But as economic conditions had changed, he said, consumers
had been led to make proposals for improving its functioning.
    He added that the adoption of the new agreement "attests to
the importance of rubber and confidence in the rubber industry."

<title>ECUADOR TO ASK OPEC TO RAISE EXPORT QUOTA</title>
<dateline>    CARACAS, March 12 - </dateline>Ecuador will ask OPEC to raise its oil
export quota by 100,000 barrels per day to 310,000 to
compensate for lost output due to last week's earthquake,
deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite said.
    Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss
an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached.
    The additional output would be related to plans now under
discussion for Venezuela and Mexico to lend Ecuador crude while
it repairs a pipeline damaged by the quake.
    Earlier, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Aturo
Hernandez Grisanti said his country would supply an unspecified
part of Ecuador's export commitments.
    But Santos Alvite told reporters he hoped a first cargo of
300,000 barrels could leave Maracaibo this weekend to supply
refineries near Guayaquil. He added Ecuador also wanted to make
up for 50,000 bpd it shipped to Caribbean destinations. Mexico
might supply Ecuador's South Korean market.
    Ecuador may be unable to export oil for up to five months
due to extensive damage to a 25 mile stretch of pipeline
linking jungle oilfields to the Pacific port of Balao.

<title>NEC CORP TARGETS HOME ELECTRONICS BUSINESS</title>
<author>    By Linda Sieg, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 27 - </dateline>The president of Japan's biggest high
technology firm, NEC Corp <NIPN.T>, is anything but worried,
despite growing anti-Japanese protectionism, a soaring yen, and
a stagnant world electronics market.
    "The company's structure was developed by looking ahead,"
Tadahiro Sekimoto told Reuters in an interview.
    "We assumed the era of a strong yen, trade friction and
globalisation would arrive, and we moved ahead on that basis.
There's no need to change our strategy now."
    However, the world's largest manufacturer of microchips,
the tiny silicon wafers which are the brains of most high
technology products, knows it must keep looking ahead if it is
to survive.
    Hoping to build on existing strengths, NEC is now turning
its focus on home electronics, an area of past weakness,
Sekimoto said.
    NEC wants to follow its corporate slogan "C and C" (Computers
and Communications) to create high level home electronics that
go beyond mere televisions and video tape recorders, Sekimoto
said.
    Home electronics accounted for only eight pct of NEC's
total 2,334.67 billion yen sales on a consolidated basis in the
year ended March 31, 1986.
    Industry analysts say NEC is wise to target what will be a
major growth market in the future, but some warn the company
faces some stiff competition.
    "This is where the market is going to be for a long time --
in products that combine personal computers, video display and
telecommunications networks," said Salomon Brothers (Asia) Ltd
analyst Carole Ryavec. "But Matsushita (Electric Industrial Co
Ltd) may be there first."
    But Sekimoto argues that NEC's overall strengths will carry
the day.
    "Many companies are in the top 10 in computers or microchips
or telecommunications, but none is in the top 10 in all three.
NEC is unique in that respect," he said.
    To help its already high rankings, NEC will further
increase the high level of offshore production which makes it
one of the most multinational of Japan's electronics firms.
    The company will increase offshore output of all goods it
sells overseas to 50 pct from a current 25 pct over the next
several years, Sekimoto said.
    But the firm plans to go it alone in expanding overseas,
despite moving last year to become joint owner, along with
France's Cie des Machines Bull <BULP.P>, of U.S. Firm Honeywell
Inc's <HON> Information Systems unit.
    "We hope to increase our share in the U.S. Market through
the Honeywell tie-up. But our basic strategy is to take an
independent and autonomous route," said Sekimoto.
    The company also plans to maintain its independent line by
continuing to make computers which are not compatible with
those of International Business Machines Corp <IBM>, he said.
    "Among the Japanese competitors, only NEC hasn't been caught
in software copyright disputes with IBM and our profits and
market share have gradually expanded," Sekimoto said.
    Once new ways of linking non-compatible computers are
perfected, IBM compatibility will be irrelevant. "What will
matter is the best hardware, the best software and the best
ability to meet customers needs," Sekimoto said.
    In fact, NEC, which has over half of Japan's personal
computer market, may go to court to stop competitors selling
cheaper machines which can run NEC software but infringe
copyright on its operating system, an NEC spokesman said.
    While industry analysts give NEC high marks for looking
ahead, they note that it failed in forecasting microchip
demand. Like other Japanese chipmakers, the firm was left with
serious excess capacity when lean years followed the boom
times.
    But after two years of cutbacks in capital investment in
the sector, Sekimoto thinks the time has come to boost spending
again, if only slightly.
    "We're not going to increase production. But we are going to
invest in new product development and upgrade existing plant,"
he said.
    Despite NEC's admitted strengths, analysts note the company
faces tough times due to stagnant markets.
    "NEC has excellent worldwide capacity and technology, but
they are caught in a downturn which may last a long time," said
Salamon's Ryavec.
    The company forecasts such troubles will slash parent net
profits to 30 billion yen in the year ending March 31, 1987,
down 43 pct from the previous year, although sales are expected
to rise eight pct to 2,130 billion yen.
    Profits will improve only slightly next year, rising to 38
billion yen on sales of 2,350 billion, it said.

<title>DUTCH COCOA PROCESSORS UNHAPPY WITH ICCO BUFFER</title>
<author>    By Jeremy Lovell, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    ROTTERDAM, June 1 - </dateline>Dutch cocoa processors are unhappy with
the intermittent buying activities of the International Cocoa
Organization's buffer stock manager, industry sources told
Reuters.
    "The way he is operating at the moment is doing almost
nothing to support the market. In fact he could be said to be
actively depressing it," one company spokesman said.
    Including the 3,000 tonnes he acquired on Friday, the total
amount of cocoa bought by the buffer stock manager since he
recently began support operations totals 21,000 tonnes.
    Despite this buying, the price of cocoa is well under the
1,600 Special Drawing Rights, SDRs, a tonne level below which
the bsm is obliged to buy cocoa off the market.
    "Even before he started operations, traders estimated the
manager would need to buy at least up to his 75,000 tonnes
maximum before prices moved up to or above the 1,600 SDR level,
and yet he appears reluctant to do so," one manufacturer said.
    "We all hoped the manager would move into the market to buy
up to 75,000 tonnes in a fairly short period, and then simply
step back," he added.
    "The way the manager is only nibbling at the edge of the
market at the moment is actually depressing sentiment and the
market because everyone is holding back from both buying and
selling waiting to see what the manager will do next," one
processor said.
    "As long as his buying tactics remain the same the market is
likely to stay in the doldrums, and I see no indication he is
about to alter his methods," he added.
    Processors and chocolate manufacturers said consumer prices
for cocoa products were unlikely to be affected by buffer stock
buying for some time to come.

<title>PHILIPPINE CENTRAL BANKER FACES CORRUPTION CHARGES</title>
<author>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    MANILA, March 24 - </dateline>A government-appointed special
prosecutor has ordered the filing of corruption charges over
the closure of a private bank against Philippine central bank
governor Jose Fernandez, who said he would contest the charges.
    Ombudsman Raul Gonzalez told Reuters there was evidence to
indicate that Fernandez had misused his office in ordering the
closure of <Pacific Banking Corp> in July, 1985.
    He said the charges against Fernandez would be filed "within
the week" in a special court for corruption cases, adding that a
defendant could appeal against a ruling in the Supreme Court.
    Fernandez is in New York for talks with the Philippines'
creditor banks on rescheduling about 9.4 billion dlrs of the
country's foreign debt.
    A central bank statement quoted Fernandez as saying Pacific
Bank's closure and sale were in accordance with law.
    "Fernandez said that some points may have been missed in the
appreciation of the case for which reason he will be filing a
motion for reconsideration of the (Ombudsman's) resolution," the
statement said.
    Central bank sources said the statement was drafted after
Fernandez and senior deputy governor Gabriel Singson, who is in
Manila, conferred on the telephone.
    Gonzalez said his office ordered the charges filed after
hearing submissions by Fernandez and plaintiff Paula Paug, the
president of Pacific Bank's Employees Union.
    In her complaint, Paug said Fernandez had acted arbitrarily
in ordering the closure of Pacific Bank and placing it under
receivership without giving the bank the right to appeal,
throwing hundreds of employees out of work.
    Paug also said Fernandez had not withdrawn his stockholding
in Far East Bank and Trust Company, which took over Pacific
Bank's assets, when he became central bank governor in January,
1984. Fernandez founded Far East in 1960.
    She alleged Fernandez had misused his position by
appointing two Far East bank executives to central bank
consultancies, giving them access to Pacific Bank records. She
also disputed Fernandez' interpretation of Pacific's accounts
from January 1980 to May 1985, claiming the bank had made a
profit, not a loss.
    The central bank statement quoted Fernandez as stressing
that Pacific Bank was "repeatedly given notice of the continuing
losses of the bank and the immediate need of putting up
additional capital to eliminate insolvency."
    It said the central bank tried to assist in a bid by Bank
of Hawaii and Philippine sugar trader Antonio Chan to purchase
Pacific Bank, but the negotiations collapsed "because of certain
legal impediments."
    The statement said the central bank invited several banks
to submit offers for Pacific, and the sale to Far East was
approved by the Monetary Board and not by Fernandez alone.
    Fernandez was also quoted in the statement as saying he had
divested himself of all interests in Far East Bank when he
became central bank governor. A Far East Bank spokesman
declined comment on the charges against Fernandez.
    In a footnote to a 12-page resolution recommending
prosecution against Fernandez, Gonzalez said prima facie
evidence of misuse of power also existed against all the then
members of the country's Monetary Board, as well as the Far
East executives, and ordered their investigation.
    He said Fernandez's action fitted in with the political
climate during former President Ferdinand Marcos's final years.
    "(The) prevailing mood of the day for those in high offices
was either to imitate the penchant of then President Marcos and
his wife, to run roughshod over the human rights of citizens
... Or to follow blindly or with canine devotion any
instructions from above," Gonzalez wrote.
    Gonzalez, named to his post 11 months ago, said his office
had received more than 4,000 complaints of misuse of power. He
said among those facing prosecution were five provincial
governors appointed by President Corazon Aquino.

<title>VENEZUELA TO LEND ECUADOR 50,000 BPD OF CRUDE</title>
<dateline>    CARACAS, March 12 - </dateline>Venezuela will lend Ecuador 50,000
barrels per day of crude oil over the next few months to help
it meet its export commitments, Energy and Mines Minister
Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said today.
    He said that under the terms of this loan, agreed during a
visit here this week by Ecuador's Deputy Energy Minister
Fernando Santos Alvite, Ecuador will begin repaying the loan in
August.
    Hernandez Grisanti said the loan will go part way to
offsetting the loss of Ecuador's 140,000 in exports caused by
earthquake damage to 25 miles of pipeline last week.
    Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline
connecting its jungle oil fields with the pacific port of Balao
was put out of action.
    Venezuela has an output quota of 1.495 bpd, while Ecuador's
is 210,000 bpd. Santos Alvite said Ecuador will ask OPEC to
allow it to produce 100,000 bpd above its quota when the
pipeline is repaired to offset present production losses.
    Hernandez Grisanti said also a first 300,000 barrels
shipment of Venezuelan crude oil will leave for Ecuador this
weekend to help meet domestic consumption needs.
    The oil, part of a five mln additional crude oil loan by
Venezuela, will be processed at Guayaquil refineries.
    "If we had not supplied oil to Ecuador the life of this
country would have ground to a halt," he said.

<title>EARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING</title>
<author>    By Andrew Hill, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 5 - </dateline>OPEC crude oil output in the first few
days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16
mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd
ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows.
    The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil
traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle
East, Africa, Latin America and Asia.
    They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the
group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to
a fixed price system, which came into effect last month.
    OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd
above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the
United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show.
    The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador,
was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the
survey reveals.
    But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall
in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran"s inability to
export as much as its quota allows.
    Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced
1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed.
    Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to
3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February,
against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a
200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production.
    Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was
estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in
early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share
of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota.
    Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some
OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria,
both substantially under quota in February and early March.
    Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to
180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota.
    Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar"s
prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any
shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers.
    Nigeria's early March output was about one mln bpd, down
from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd.
    Industry sources say Nigeria's customers believe its Bonny
grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes
from the U.K. North Sea.
    Country-by-country production figures are as follows, in
mln bpd -

<dateline>    TOKYO, April 8 - </dateline>The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
has proposed expanding imports of 12 farm products named in a
U.S. Complaint against Japan to the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade last year, an LDP official said.
    The products include fruit juices, purees and pulp, some
tomato products, peanuts, prepared beef products and beans.
    The proposal will be used as the basis for a more detailed
LDP economic package to cut the trade surplus with the U.S. The
party is expected to formalise the package before April 19,
when LDP General Council Chairman Shintaro Abe visits
Washington.

<title>GOULD <GLD> INTRODUCES NEW MINI SUPERCOMPUTERS</title>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, March 25 - </dateline>Gould Inc said it is introducing a new
generation of very high performance mini supercomputers for
intensive engineering applications.
    Called the NPL, the mini supercomputers use Gould's UTX/32
operating system, which is a compatible multi-processor
extension of the UNIX operating system consisting of complete
AT and T System V and Berkeley BSD 4.3 environments, company
officials said at a teleconference.
    "The introduction of the NPL family of mini supercomputers,
is by far Gould's most significant computer line developed to
date," chairman James McDonald said.
    Patrick Rickard, computer systems president, said that he
expects sales of NPL family computers to account for 20 pct of
the division's revenues for the first year after its
introduction, and increase to 80 pct of revenues in five years.
    Computer operations accounted for one third or about 300
mln dlrs of Gould's total revenues for 1986 of 908.8 mln dlrs,
a company spokesman said.
    The NP1, the first series of the new family, uses an open
systems architecture, including parallel and high speed vector
processing and "massive" memory to achieve its supercomputing
capability, Gould officers said.
    The NP1 family will form the foundation for new systems
which are expected to be brought to market through the 1990s,
McDonald said.
    The computers are expected to have applications in science
and engineering, in aerospace and defense and extend into other
areas such as medical sciences, Rick Baron, senior director of
marketing development said.
    Gould said it priced and packaged the NP1 at a cost which
will provide the power and advantages of a traditional
supercomputer at a fraction of the cost.
    The NP1 product line includes several models priced from
395,000 dlrs to 2.9 mln dlrs, Gould officials said adding that
the company has already signed orders for eight NP1 systems.
    The low-end NP1 models will be available in the 1987 third
quarter and the high-end will be available in the 1988 first
quarter, they said.
    According to Gould officials, the NP1 cost 50 mln dlrs to
develop and the company plans to spend between 100 to 150 mln
to develop the rest of the family line. Between now and 1995,
the company expects to ship two to three billion dlrs of NP1
mini supercomputers.
    Offering up to 96 mln Whetstone instructions per second and
320 mln floating point operations per second, the largest of
the new systems, Model 480, incorporates up to four billion
bytes of physical memory, they said.
    The NP1 family has connectability but not compatability
with IBM and Xerox computers, a company spokesman said.

<title>PARIBAS PLAN TO ADJUST ECUADOR LOAN TERMS OPPOSED</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 15 - </dateline>Banque Paribas, which arranged a 220
mln dlr loan for Ecuador last year to pre-finance oil exports,
wants to adjust the terms of the facility to help the country
recover from a devastating earthquake, bankers said.
    But the French bank's plan, which would effectively
postpone repayment of about 30 mln dlrs of the loan for several
months, is running into stiff resistance from many of the 52
members of the loan syndicate.
    The pipeline that carries all Ecuador's oil exports was
ruptured in the March 5 tremor and will take about five months
to repair at a cost of some 150 mln dlrs.
    President Leon Febres Cordero on Friday estimated total
damage caused by the quake at one billion dlrs and said that as
a result Ecuador would maintain January's suspension of
interest payments on its foreign commercial bank debt.
    Payments were halted in January because of the drop in the
price of oil, which accounts for nearly two-thirds of Ecuador's
export earnings and 60 pct of government revenue.
    Many banks in the Paribas facility, although sympathetic to
Ecuador's plight, feel that emergency financial relief is a job
for international financial organisations and not for
commercial banks, bankers said.
    The 18-month oil-financing facility, which was signed last
October 28, is one of the few purely voluntary credits for a
Latin American nation since the region's debt crisis erupted in
August 1982.
    Because it was a voluntary deal, many bankers feel strongly
that the orginal terms must be adhered to. Otherwise, they
fear, the gradual re-establishment of normal market conditions
for Latin borrowers will be set back.
    "There's a lot of reluctance by the other banks. They feel
it's a different facility, and so any kind of suggestion of a
restructuring would look bad," one banker said.

<title>MINISTERS FEEL EC FORECASTS TOO PESSIMISTIC</title>
<dateline>    BRUSSELS, March 9 - </dateline>European Community finance ministers
discussed the economic outlook for the 12-nation bloc and many
said a recent gloomy forecast by the EC Commission was too
pessimistic.
    The Commission, the EC's executive authority, two weeks ago
cut its forecast for economic growth in the Community to 2.3
per cent for this year from 2.8 per cent predicted last autumn.
    It said economic prospects had been less promising over the
past few months because of a sharp fall in the value of the
dollar and a slowing of world trade -- factors which would
restrain Community exports.
    But diplomats said several member states, led by West
Germany, Britain and France, felt the forecast was too gloomy,
especially since it was drafted before a recent agreement
between the leading Western economic powers to stabilise
currencies around current levels.
    "Many delegations feel the (Commission's) report is rather
too pessimistic," said Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens,
who chaired the meeting.
    The Commission, which slashed its growth forecast for West
Germany to two per cent from 3.2 per cent, has made clear it
feels Bonn has room to introduce additional measures to
stimulate its economy that would benefit the rest of Europe.
    But two top German officials, State Secretaries Otto
Schlecht and Hans Tietmeyer, told reporters Bonn saw no need at
the moment for action to bolster the EC's biggest economy.
    The diplomats said they were backed by Britain and France,
while Italy, Greece and Denmark supported the Commission's view
that Bonn should bring in new measures to aid EC growth.

    S and P cited GAF's 3.2 billion dlr acquisition offer for
Borg-Warner Corp <BOR>. Pro forma, debt leverage would rise to
nearly 90 pct, assuming total financing. But proceeds from
asset sales would probably pay down debt, the agency noted.
    Borg-Warner's 420 mln dlr A-plus senior debt and A-1
commercial paper were placed on creditwatch December one. S and
P said it will review the timing and extent of asset sales,
debt reduction and strategic benefits of the purchase.

<title>ECUADOR INDUSTRY AND TRADE MINISTER RESIGNS</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, March 19 - </dateline>Ecuador's Minister for Industry and Trade
resigned today, but denied he was responding to recent protests
against a new austerity program that went into effect after a
devastating earthquake.
    Xavier Neira, an economist, told reporters he was stepping
down for personal reasons and would return to his private
business as a foreign trade consultant.
    He defended government austerity measures adopted last
Friday as a "necessary antidote" to the losses from the March
five quake which cost an estimated one billion dlrs in damage
and left 1,000 people dead or missing.
     Ecuadoran unions have called for a general strike next
Wednesday to press for a suspension of the belt-tightening
measures, which include a rise in gasoline prices of up to 80
pct, budget cuts of up 10 pct and a government hiring freeze.
    Ecuador, a member of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC), has been forced to halt shipments
of crude, its main export, for about five months until it
repairs a pipeline that ruptured as a result of the quake.

    "We believe Chrysler's purchase is a logical and sound step
for all concerned," the union said.
    The UAW is negotiating with AMC over the carmaker's demand
for economic concessions covering workers at its Wisconsin
operations, without which AMC has said it would cease vehicle

<title>CBT SOYBEAN FUTURES CLOSE STRONG IN NEW CROP</title>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </dateline>CBT soybean futures closed on a strong
note in new crop, showing gains of 4-3/4 to 9-1/4 cents per
bushel in moderate trade. May settled at 5.04-1/2 dlrs after
posting a 5-1/2 cent range, with November at 5.04-3/4.
    Slow country movement, steady to firmer cash soybean basis
values and a delayed Brazilian harvest combined to support
futures from the opening, despite a disappointing drop in the
weekly soybean export figure yesterday, traders said.
    The advance above the psychologically important 5.00 dlr
mark in both old and new crop kept the chart picture bullish,
which could limit declines when South American sales begin to
pick up later this month, they added.
    A local house steadily bought new crop November, with
another local house spreading July/Nov, pit brokers said.

<title>SENIOR ECONOMIST PREDICTS 30 PCT FALL IN DOLLAR</title>
<dateline>    panama city, april 29 - </dateline>a senior economist predicted the
u.s. dollar would decline another 30 pct by year-end, but said
he foresees no significant change in u.s. interest rates.
    "the market recognizes another 30 pct dollar depreciation is
necessary," said rudiger dornbush of the massachusetts institute
of technology.
    he said the only thing preventing the dollar from dropping
far below current levels was intervention by central banks in
definace of market forces.
    he said artifical support of the dollar had put the world's
financial markets in an "excessively volatile" position, however,
and predicted that within about four months "it is going to be
very difficult to keep the dollar in place."
    the forecasts, dornbush added, are for "a steady
deterioration from now on."
    dornbush, a university of chicago-educated economist, works
with the national bureau of economic research as well as mit.
he spoke here at the invitation of panama's national banking
association, sponsor of a three-day international banking
convention that got under way yesterday.
    dornbush discarded fears of soaring u.s. interest rates
because of the declining dollar.
    "the u.s. cannot raise interest rates. if it raises interest
rates all the debts will bounce in the foreign sector ... and
all over latin america," he said.

<title>BENETTON SEES HIGHER PROFIT, SALES IN 1987</title>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, June 1 - </dateline>Italian fashion conglomerate Benetton
Group Spa <BTOM.MI> expects its net profit to rise to around
135 billion lire in 1987 from 113 billion the year before, Aldo
Palmeri, managing director of Benetton Group, said.
    Palmeri told a presentation here that sales should increase
to between 1,280 and 1,300 billion lire in 1987 from 1,079
billion in 1986, of which foreign sales were expected to take
up 850 billion lire.
    Benetton finance director Carlo Gilardi said the company
was planning to diversify further into the financial services
sector and would also expand into the shoe business.
    Benetton expanded into financial services mainly to speed
up the development of its own systems, Gilardi said. Benetton
has 400 sub-contractors and 600 distributor companies which
created a demand for such services. "But we do not plan to
abandon our traditional business," Gilardi said.
    Benetton plans to expand further outside Italy, especially
in the Far East. Talks are under way over a possible joint
venture with the Soviet Union and with South Korea.
    Palmeri said Benetton plans to list its shares in
Frankfurt, London, New York and Tokyo as part of its global
expansion but gave no dates when the listings would take place.

<title>ECUADOR SEEKS 450 MLN DLRS IN EMERGENCY CREDIT</title>
<author>    By Jorge Aguirre, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    QUITO, March 18 - </dateline>Ecuador is seeking between 437 and 450
mln dlrs in loans this year from multilateral organisations and
foreign governments to grapple with economic losses from a
devastating earthquake 13 days ago, a presidential economic
adviser said.
    Foreign governments and multilateral organisations hold
one-third of Ecuador's 8.16 billion dlrs total foreign debt, he
said in a news conference at the presidential palace.
    But he added that the suspension of payments to private
foreign banks, who hold the rest of the foreign debt, would be
prolonged though the government hoped to negotiate an agreement
with these creditors.
    President Leon Febres Cordero says the earthquake cost the
country one billion dlrs in losses and left 1,000 people dead
or missing.
    Swett, who was Finance Minister of Ecuador between August
1984 to June 1986, added: "With the private foreign banks there
has been a ceasing of payments by Ecuador.
    "We are bringing forward the respective negotiations whose
conclusion we hope finalises in the next few weeks."
    Finance Minister Domingo Cordovez said last week that
quake-hit Ecuador sought through negotiations to postpone all
payments due to the private foreign banks in 1987 until next
year.
    Although Swett gave no gave details on the latest plan for
negotiations with private foreign banks, he calculated the
suspension of payment to these creditors would save the
government 54.45 billion sucres.
    This amount is equal to 363 mln dlrs at the free rate of
150 sucres to the dollar -- the rate Swett said reporters
should use in calculating the dollar equivalent.
    The Ecuadorean central bank, which is the institution
remitting debt payments abroad, uses the official rate of 95
sucres to the dollar for its accounting purposes. At the
official rate, the 54.45 billion sucres' sum equals 573 mln
dlrs.
    Ecuador, squeezed by a slide last year in prices for crude,
its main export, suspended payments to private foreign banks in
January.
    Swett said the government would also seek to refinance the
1.429 billion dlr section of the debt owed to the Paris Club
group of foreign governments, though it would continue to
service the debt with them. He gave no more details.
    The government adopted a tough austerity program last
Friday intended to grapple with the tremor's economic costs.
But the country's labour unions have called a general strike
for Wednesday to press for a suspension of the program.
    The 500,000-strong Unitary Workers' Front (FUT) and the
100,000-member General Union of Workers (UGT) called the strike
to cancel the measures, which include a rise in petrol prices
of up to 80 per cent and budget cuts of as much as 10 per cent.
    The leftist-led FUT said it was also backing a call by the
Maoist Popular Movement for Democracy (MPD) party, to have
Congress impeach and oust Febres Cordero, a conservative, for
having adopted the austerity measures.

in a move to diversify into high technology, invested eight mln
dlrs in GTX.
    Nippon's move was the result of current exchange rates and
the revaluation of the yen, which "have made the U.S.
electronics industry an attractive investment opportunity for
Japanese corporations," according to a GTX statement.
    GTX noted that Nippon is expecting sales of 27 billion dlrs

    Ecuador suspended oil exports, which made up 55 pct of the
value of its total exports in 1986, for five months this year
after an earthquake in March shattered the country's pipeline.
    The central bank said the value of exports from January to
August 1987 stood at 1.132 billion dlrs and imports 1.204
billion dlrs. Net international monetary reserves declined to
57.5 mln dlrs at end-September from 146.8 mln dlrs at end-

<title>ECUADOR SAYS SUSPENDS OIL EXPORTS DUE EARTHQUAKE</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, March 6 - </dateline>Ecuador today suspended its crude oil
exports indefinitely due to an earthquake last night that
damaged pumping and crude transport installations, an Energy
and Mines MInistry statement said.
    It said the state oil firm Corporacion Estatal Petrolera
Ecuatoriana (CEPE) notified foreign customers that it was
declaring force majeure on its crude exports due to the tremor.
    Ecuador"s OPEC oil output quota is 210,000 barrels per day
(bpd).
    A senior energy ministry official said that one pumping
station at El Salado on Ecuador's main pipeline was damaged.
    He also said an 180 metre section of the pipeline attached
to the bridge over the Aguarico river collapsed.
    The pumping station was about 20 km from the Reventador
volcano, near the epicentre of the quake, which Ecuadorean
seismologists said registered six on the 12-point international
Mercalli scale. The Aguarico bridge was also close to the
volcano, he said.
    The quake struck northern Ecaudor and southern Colombia,
according to Ecuadorean officials. No injuries were reported.

<title>BP SAYS NO PLANS TO CLOSE SWEDISH REFINERY</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, April 2 - </dateline>The British Petroleum Co Plc <BP.L> said
it had no plans to close its refinery in Gothenburg, despite
forecasts by a Swedish finance ministry committee that it might
be planning such a move.
    The committee said the refinery's future looked bleak
because the Swedish petroleum industry's competitiveness was
expected to worsen unless it invested, and because of the
effects of a possible tightening of rules on sulphur content.
    But BP said the unit, in which Sweden's <OK Petroleum AB>
has a 22 pct stake, had performed well both technically and
financially up to and including the first quarter of 1987.
    Current restrictions on sulphur emissions and known future
plans for both Sweden and export markets did not cause it any
serious problems, it said in a statement.
    The refinery started up in 1967 and has an annual capacity
of 4.7 mln tonnes.

    The agency cut to Aa-3 from Aa-2 Dayton Hudson's senior
notes, debentures, revenue bonds and Eurodebt, and shelf
registration to Provisional Aa-3 from Provisional Aa-2.
    Moody's said it expected that leverage, which has risen
because of an aggressive expansion program, would remain high
due to the company's spending plans. The agency noted that
Dayton Hudson's operating returns recently declined.
    But Moody's also said the company's recent operating
problems would probably be temporary.

<title>BRITAIN, JAPAN CLASH OVER STOCK MARKET ACCESS</title>
<author>    By Rich Miller, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 8 - </dateline>Britain and Japan clashed today over U.K.
Demands for greater access to the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) as
trade tensions between the two countries mounted.
    British consumer affairs minister Michael Howard told
reporters he was dissatisfied with the exchange's response to
Britain's non-negotiable timetable for increased British
membership and warned of possible reprisals in the future.
    He described his meeting with Tokyo stock exchange (TSE)
head Michio Takeuchi, in which he demanded greater exchange
access, as "very frank indeed."
    In a separate press conference, TSE President Michio
Takeuchi said the exchange has done its utmost to liberalise
its membership and called on Britain to make some concessions.
    According to Takeuchi, Howard wants three British firms to
be named members of the Tokyo stock exchange by the end of this
year. Neither Takeuchi nor Howard would name the companies.
    "Next May is the earliest possible date for opening our
membership and I want the British government to understand
this," Takeuchi said.
    Membership cannot be increased before space on the trading
floor is expanded in May 1988, he said.
     Howard told reporters that was not good enough and said
that Britain would use its powers to ban Japanese financial
institutions from London if it was not satisfied with Tokyo.
    Japan has until the next meeting of senior officials from
the two countries in May or June to come up with a postive
response to the British timetable or face retaliation, he said.
    "The timetable was constructed in a way that made it a very
reasonable request and I expect it to be met," he said.
    Asked about the exchange's argument that it has no floor
space to expand membership, Howard replied, "We find it very
difficult in our country to understand why the considerable
ingenuity and resourcefulness of the Japanese (in world
markets) is unable to overcome problems of that kind."
    While here, Howard said he also expressed frustration with
the huge trade imbalance with Japan and with Tokyo's handling
of demands by Britain's Cable and Wireless for a greater role
in Japan's telecommunications business.
    According to Japanese newspaper reports, at least some of
that message may have penetrated.
    According to several reports, the Post and
Telecommunications Ministry is considering a Cable and Wireless
proposal for a telephone cable between Japan and the U.S.
    Ministry officials were unavailable for comment.

the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission dismissed
charges of sex and age discrimination filed against it by
members of the Independent Federation of Flight Attendants.
    The union went on strike in March 1986 after failing to
agree on a contract and charged that the airline sought greater
wage concessions from the flight attendants because they were
predominantly female.
    TWA said the commission found that there is no reason to
believe these allegations are true.

<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </dateline>Rep. Anthony Beilenson, D-Cal, said
he introduced legislation to triple the federal excise taxes on
beer and on two types of wine which have the least alcohol.
    His bill would raise the tax on beer from nine dlrs to 27
dlrs per 31-gallon barrel, an increase of about 32 cents per
six pack. The tax on the two types of wine would go from 17
cents to 51 cents per gallon and from 67 cents to 2.01 dlrs per
gallon respectively, he said in a statement.
    "Raising the tax rates on beer and wine is an entirely
justifiable means of reducing the deficit. It would also
modestly discourage excessive drinking," Beilenson said.

<title>JAPAN CLARIFIES FUND MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 13 - </dateline>The Finance Ministry has clarified
regulations governing fund management, satisfying overseas
critics who charged the rules were too tightly-drawn, ministry
officials and Western diplomats said.
    They said "double licensing" has been dropped so a foreign
fund management firm need apply only for a licence for its
Japanese subsidiary and not for the parent company as well.
    A foreign investment management company will be permitted
to employ only one fund manager in Japan, with another on
standby in the home country. Domestic companies must have two.
    In deciding whether a Japanese subsidiary of a foreign firm
is eligible to manage funds in Japan, the ministry will take
account of the amount of funds the parent company has under
management, a ministry official said.
    "This should make it very easy for foreign firms to meet the
criteria for a licence," he said without elaborating.
    He said the ministry expects to grant the first investment
management licences by the end of June. Some 135 firms,
including some 15 foreign companies, will probably be licensed
under the new law passed late last year.

<title>U.S. OIL DEPENDENCY SEEN RISING TO RECORD LEVEL</title>
<dateline>    SAN FRANCISCO, April 9 - </dateline>The United States' dependency on
foreign oil sources may reach record levels by the mid-1990s,
according to John H. Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry
Research Associates.
    Lichtblau, speaking at an alternative energy conference
here, said the U.S. may depend on foreign suppliers for as much
as 52 pct of its oil by 1995, surpasssing the previous high
level of 47 pct in 1977.
    "The long term growth in dependency on foreign oil is
inevitable," Lichtblau said. As much as 30 pct of U.S. oil
imports in 1995 could come from OPEC nations, he said.
    Lichtblau said the U.S. depended on foreign suppliers for
33 pct of its oil in 1986 and predicted that would increase to
40 pct by 1990.
    "However, the rate of this growth can be affected
positively or negatively through government action or
inaction," Lichtblau said.
    He said that one of the government's negative actions is
the maintenance of the windfall profits tax which acts as a
disincentive to developing existing fields and reduces cash
flow for oil exploration.
    Lichtblau called for the adoption of an international floor
price for crude oil to help stabilize world oil prices.
    "An international floor price adopted by all or most
industrial countries would clearly be a much more effective
measure and would be much less distortive for the U.S. than if
we imposed it alone," Lichtblau said.
    Development of alternate energy sources such as synthetic
fuels as well as increased development in Alaska could lessen
U.S. dependency on foreign oil, Lichtblau said.
    A potential for alternative supplies could limit the
willingness of OPEC nations to raise oil prices, he said.
    Lichtblau also called for the federal government to offer
tax abatements for oil drilling, to fill the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve at a faster rate and to develop pilot plans
for alternative energy.

    "The magnitude of the damages caused by the earthquake is
gigantic," President Leon Febres Cordero said after inspecting
the damages in Napo, the hardest-hit jungle province.
    Shaking loose earth from hills, the thursday night quake
triggered landslides, swelling the Aguarico river which burst
it banks carrying away homes and huts in Napo province, health
minister Jorge Brancho told reuters.
    "We fear that up to 300 people died in napo though there is
no way of now knowing the exact figure because there are many
disappeared."

<title>DOLLAR ENDS LOWER IN LACKLUSTRE FRANKFURT</title>
<author>    By Allan Saunderson, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, April 9 - </dateline>The dollar drifted down to end one
pfennig lower after a lacklustre session, held in limits by the
lack of concrete news from the Group of Seven meeting and
comments on the edge of the Washington IMF/World Bank meeting.
    Dealers said the communique early in the European morning
from the G-7 meeting contained no significant new factors and
although the dollar dipped it generally resisted further
attempts to push it lower through the day.
    The U.S. Currency ended at 1.8270/80 marks, below
yesterday's last 1.8365/75.
    Koch said the assessment of the dollar's direction was
based on a global view, with operators paying most attention to
comments by finance officials to see how closely they stated
adherence to international agreements such as those set at the
Plaza Hotel in 1985 and in Paris on February 22.
    Koch described the wording of the communique from the G-7
as "soft as wax."
    Bundebank vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in
a telephone interview that the German central bank sees no
current reason to change monetary course at present.
    Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks
yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West
Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which dealers
said revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts
may be under consideration.
    German call money was slightly softer today, at around 3.70
pct after 3.80 yesterday.
    Some dealers said rates on new liquidity injections added
via Bundesbank securities repurchase agreements may be cut next
week. Hopes of a cut were dashed on Tuesday with an allocation
at an unchanged 3.80 pct.
    But speaking of the pact tender rate next week, Schlesinger
said, "since the central bank council gives its opinion on this
theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable."
    Euromark rates scarcely responded to the central bankers
comments, with six months funds ending unaltered at around
3-7/8 pct. Eurodollars for the same maturity rose a fractional
1/16 pct from yesterday to around 6-11/16 pct.
    Sterling dipped to end at 2.952/956 marks after 2.960/965
last night. The Swiss franc firmed slightly to 120.30/45 marks
per 100 from 120.25/40, with the yen soaring however to
1.2570/90 marks per 100 from 1.2515/35 yesterday.
    EMS currencies saw the French franc end unchanged from last
night at 30.03/06 marks per 100, with the Belgian franc easing
however to 4.829/831 marks per 100 from 4.831/833.

<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 31 - </dateline>The recently passed Senate bank bill,
which called for a one-year freeze on new bank services and
barred the creation of limited service banks, could hamper
foreign banks' operations here, said Lawrence Uhlick, incoming
executive director of the Institute of Foreign Bankers Inc.
    "The language is very unclear and very troublesome," he
told a press briefing.
    He said the institute, which represents 230 international
banks operating in the U.S., would lobby for changes in the
final version of the bank bill, which still has to go through
the House and the conference process before becoming law.

<title>INTERSTATE (I) CHIEF DOUBTFUL ON BRAZIL DEBT</title>
<dateline>    LOS ANGELES, April 24 - </dateline>First Interstate Bank Corp Chairman
Joseph Pinola said he was not optimistic about the prospects
for a resolution of the Brazilian debt situation during the
current year.
    "I am not as optimistic personally on a resolution as some
others are," Pinola told reporters after the company's annual
meeting.
    He said it did not seem likely that the Brazilian
government has the will to take the steps necessary to resolve
their domestic economic difficulties.
   
    In February, Brazil suspended interest payment on about 68
bln dlrs of its commercial debt. Many U.S. banks have placed
their Brazilian loans on non-accrual status as a result of this
action, but they also expressed confidence that Brazil and U.S.
lenders could resolve the situation before the end of the year.

<title>GATT OFFICIAL MEETS WITH U.S. FARM LEADERS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 8 - </dateline>The official in charge of
agricultural matters in the new round of global trade talks is
in Washington today and tomorrow to meet with congressional and
Reagan administration officials.
    Aart de Zeeuw, chairman of the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade's negotiating group on agriculture, met this morning
with members of the House Agriculture Committee.
    Committee sources said De Zeeuw expressed concern over
protectionism and high farm price supports. House lawmakers
noted that in 1985 the United States took steps to reduce loan
rates, committee staff said.
    "Members told him (De Zeeuw) that we lowered our (U.S.) loan
rates and can't eliminate subsidies unilaterally," one source
said.
    De Zeeuw was told of the U.S. lawmakers' frustration with
Japan's restrictive rice import policy, and members defended
the U.S. dairy policy, which aims to cut surplus production by
subsidizing producers to trim herds, sources said.
    Later today De Zeeuw will meet the Senate Agriculture
members and Undersecretary of State Affairs Allen Wallis.
    Tomorrow, De Zeeuw is to meet the House Ways and Means
Trade Subcommittee and the Senate Finance Committee, before
visiting Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng.
    De Zeeuw goes to Canada later this week. His trip to North
America is part of his attempt to meet farm policy leaders in
the key GATT member states.
    The negotiating group on agriculture held its first meeting
in February and is expected to meet again in May.

<title>BFG PARTIAL OPERATING PROFITS FALL SHARPLY IN 1986</title>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, March 29 - </dateline>Bank fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG
<BKFG.F>, BfG, partial operating profits fell to 182.6 mln
marks in 1986 from 313.7 mln in 1985, new majority shareholder
Aachener und Muenchener Beteiligungs-AG <AMVG.F>, AMB, said.
    But total operating and extraordinary profits, including
earnings from currency and securities trading on the bank's own
account and earnings from the sale of holdings in other firms,
were more than double the previous year's level, AMB said.
    BfG's 1986 accounts were included in a prospectus for AMB's
capital increase, which is to finance the insurance company's
acquisition of 50 pct plus one share of BfG.
    Despite the fall in partial operating profits, BfG paid an
unchanged 20 mln marks into open reserves and transferred an
unchanged 80 mln marks to its trade union holding company,
<Beteiligungsgesellschaft fuer Gemeinwirtschaft AG>, from which
AMB has acquired the majority stake.
    The bank has said its business last year suffered from the
turbulence around the troubled trade-union-owned housing
concern Neue Heimat.
    AMB said the 500 mln mark drop in BfG's business volume to
50.1 billion marks affected the interest surplus.
    The interest surplus, which fell to 897.9 mln marks from
981.1 mln, was also depressed by the 0.1 point fall in the
interest margin to 1.9 pct.
    A rise in the surplus on commission to 208.8 mln marks from
188.1 mln was not enough to compensate for this.
    The rise in total operating profits enabled BfG to step up
risk provisions, with country risks particularly emphasised
because of the continuing difficulties of some countries.
    Disclosed risk provisions, which under West German
accounting rules do not necessarily reflect the full amount,
rose to 736.3 mln marks from 224.0 mln.
    BfG's parent credit volume eased to 32.63 billion marks in
1986 from 33.51 billion. Foreign debtors accounted for 24 pct
of this credit volume, and Latin American debtors accounted for
14.7 pct of total lending to foreigners.
    BfG posted extraordinary earnings from the sale of 25.01
pct of <Volksfuersorge Deutsche Lebensversicherung AG>, 74.9
pct of <BSV Bank fuer Sparanlagen und Vermoegensbildung AG> and
five pct of <Allgemeine Hypothekenbank AG>. The sale was linked
to AMB's acquisition of a majority of BfG.
    These sales show up as 494.2 mln marks from profit transfer
agreements and 326.5 mln from writing back risk provisions.

<title>EC AGREES REDUCTION OF DIESEL EXHAUST EMISSIONS</title>
<dateline>    BRUSSELS, March 20 - </dateline>The European Community (EC) agreed
tough new rules to cut diesel exhaust emissions from trucks and
buses in an attempt to reduce air pollution threatening vast
stretches of the region's forests.
    Diplomats said EC environment ministers meeting here agreed
member states would have to reduce by 20 pct over the next few
years the emission of nitrogen oxide, widely seen as the main
source of acid rain endangering forests and lakes.
    The reduction would be compulsory for heavy vehicles, with
tougher standards imposed for new models from April 1988 and
for all new vehicles from October 1990.
    The EC's executive Commission says the emission level of
nitrogen oxide was expected to drop to 2.4 mln tonnes a year
from three mln tonnes within the 12-nation Community if all
heavy vehicles applied to the new standards.
    There are an estimated nine mln lorries and buses in use in
the EC, according to Commission figures.
    The ministers also gave West Germany a go-ahead to move
towards a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol, after Bonn
requested permission to do so to encourage the use of
low-pollution cars, diplomats said.
    West Germany will still need ministers' final approval for
such a plan. Diplomats said this was expected when EC
environment ministers meet next on May 21.
    But the ministers added that the go-ahead for West Germany
did not mean there would automatically follow a Community-wide
ban on the sale of regular leaded petrol.
    Bonn intends to keep leaded premium petrol pumps, diplomats
said. They added that, of the 97 mln cars in the EC, only 20
mln now ran on regular leaded petrol and these would risk no
damage if they switched over to premium leaded petrol.
    Under EC law, ministers have to give member states special
permission if they wish to be exempt from Community competition
laws. This would be the case if West Germany were to implement
a ban on the sale of leaded regular petrol.

<title>ENDOTRONICS <ENDO> TARGET OF INVESTIGATION</title>
<dateline>    MINNEAPOLIS, March 20 - </dateline>Endotronics Inc said it is the
target of a formal private investigation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission as well as the Federal Bureau of
Investigation.
    The company also said its independent accounts, Peat,
Marwick, Mitchell and Co, served notice that its report on
Endotronics' financial statements as of Sept 30, 1986 and for
the year then ended should no longer be relied upon.
    Endotronics said the notice from its accountants stated 
"we cannot satisfy ourselves as to the true facts of the
situation to a degree necessary to continue to be associated
with such consolidated financial statements."
    Endotronics recently reported that it was reviewing the
need to establish a reserve for all or a portion of
approximately 3,686,000 dlrs in overdue accounts receivable and
to assess the impact, if any, on prior period financial
statements in light of a dispute with one of its Japanese
distributors over payment of the overdue accounts.
    Endotronics said it was providing documentation to the
Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with that
agency's investigation.
    It also said Michael Gruenberg resigned from the company's
board of directors.

<title>DUTCH MONEY MARKET DEBT RISES IN WEEK</title>
<dateline>    AMSTERDAM, April 7 - </dateline>Loans and advances from the Dutch
Central Bank to the commercial banks rose by 1.2 billion
guilders to 10.7 billion in the week up to and including April
6, the Bank's weekly return showed.
    Paper discounted with the Bank also rose, by 477 mln
guilders to 916 mln.
    These rises were balanced by a 1.6 billion guilders rise in
the Treasury's account at the Bank, made up mainly of
repayments on housing loans by local authorities.  The
Treasury's account stood at 8.1 billion guilders, the weekly
return showed.
    The Bank's gold and currency reserves rose by 484 mln to
56.89 billion guilders, while the value of non-gold holdings
rose by 140 mln guilders, analysts said.
    They added that the rise in the reserves was merely the
result of commercial currency transactions by the Bank.
    Call money and period tariffs were only fractionally
changed this week and were seen sustaining their stable levels
since no dramatic changes in the money market debt, currently
around 10.25 billion guilders, are expected.
    Today call money traded between 5-3/8 to 5-1/2 pct and
period tariffs all between 5-5/16 to 5-7/16 pct.

<dateline>    SOUTHFIELD, MICH., April 3 - </dateline>American Motors Corp said it
will ask Jeep dealers to inspect about 20,000 Cherokee,
Wagoneer and Comanche vehicles equipped with 4.0-liter,
6-cylinder engines to determine whether the air control valve
for the fuel injection system is out of design tolerance.
    The company said it will seek about 5,000 affected
vehicles, all 1987 models, manufactured between Jan 15 and
March 3, 1987. It said the out-of-tolerance air valves may
prevent the engine speed from returning to idle when the
accelerator pedal is released, the company said.

<title>CALNY <CLNY> GETS BID FROM PEPSICO <PEP></title>
<dateline>    SAN MATEO, Calif., March 16 - </dateline>Calny Inc said it has
received an offer to be acquired by PepsiCo Inc, which already
owns 9.9 pct of Calny stock, for 11.50 dlrs per share, subject
to approval by PepsiCo and Calny boards and Calny shareholders.
    The company said its board intendsd to schedule a meeting
in the near future to review the proposal and it has asked
<Oppenheimer and Co Inc> to assist it in evaluating the offer
and advise Calny on its alternatives.
    Calny is the largest franchisee of PepsiCo's Taco Bell
restaurants, operating 143 in California, Oregon, Texas and
Washington as well as 15 La Petite Boulangerie bakeries in
Seattle.
    Calny earned 1,192,000 dlrs on sales of 56.2 mln dlrs for
the nine months ended November Four.
    On December Four, Calny rejected as inadequate an investor
group led by former president and chairman Robert A. Larive's
second offer to acquire it because the bid was inadeuqate and
subject to too many contingencies.  The group offered 11.50
dlrs and one dlr of 10 pct preferred stock per Calny share.

<title>BANK OF FRANCE AGAIN BUYING DOLLARS, SOURCES SAY</title>
<dateline>    PARIS, March 27 - </dateline>The Bank of France intervened in the
Paris foreign exchange market this morning for the third
successive day, banking sources said.
    Like yesterday, it bought dollars and sold yen in small
amounts, they said.
    One dealer said it was seen in the market twice in early
dealing, buying five mln dlrs each time.
    Other dealers also reported small-scale intervention to
stabilise the dollar after aggressive selling overnight in
Tokyo, where the Bank of Japan also intervened again.
    The dollar steadied at around 6.0650/0700 francs after
easing in early trading to 6.0615/35 from an opening 6.0700/50.
It closed yesterday at 6.0800/30.
    One major french bank said it bought 10 mln dlrs for the
central bank, selling yen, within a trading range of 148.20/30
yen to the dollar, compared with yesterday's 149.28 rate at
which intervention was carried out here.
    The yen later firmed to around 147.90/148.00.

<title>ECUADOR TO ASK OPEC TO RAISE EXPORT QUOTA</title>
<dateline>    CARACAS, March 11 - </dateline>Ecuador will ask OPEC to raise its oil
export quota by 100,000 barrels per day to 310,000 to
compensate for lost output due to last week's earthquake,
deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite said.
    Santos Alvite, who arrived in Caracas last night to discuss
an aid plan for Ecuador, did not say when the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would be approached.
    The additional output would be related to plans now under
discussion for Venezuela and Mexico to lend Ecuador crude while
it repairs a pipeline damaged by the quake.
    Earlier, Venezuelan Energy and Mines Minister Aturo
Hernandez Grisanti said his country would supply an unspecified
part of Ecuador's export commitments.
    But Santos Alvite told reporters he hoped a first cargo of
300,000 barrels could leave Maracaibo this weekend to supply
refineries near Guayaquil. He added Ecuador also wanted to make
up for 50,000 bpd it shipped to Caribbean destinations. Mexico
might supply Ecuador's South Korean market.
    Ecuador may be unable to export oil for up to five months
due to extensive damage to a 25 mile stretch of pipeline
linking jungle oilfields to the Pacific port of Balao.

<title>ATT <T> TO REDEEM 15.5 MLN PREFERRED SHARES</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 18 - </dateline>American Telephone and Telegraph said
that, effective May 1, it will spend 775 mln dlrs to redeem 
15.5 mln shares of the outstanding 16.7 mln shares in two
publicly held preferred stock issues.
    The two issues have a stated value of 50 dlrs per share and
pay 3.64 dlrs and 3.74 dlrs in annual dividends, respectively,
ATT said, adding it will redeem 7.9 mln shares of its 3.64 dlrs
pfd stock and 7.6 mln shares of its 3.74 dlrs pfd stock.
    ATT's corporate vice president and treasurer S. Lawrence
Prendergast said ATT expects to finance the redemption with
cash.
    "The redemption is part of our continuing efforts to reduce
ATT's financial risk," Predergast said. "In 1986 we reduced our
outstanding debt and preferred stock by a total of 1.6 billion
dlrs. As a result our annual fixed charges were reduced by
almost 200 mln dlrs and our ability to service our existing
debt was strengthened."
    The May one preferred stock redemption will save about 50
mln dlrs in dividends annually and will bring ATT's total debt
and preferred stock reduction to more than 2.5 billion dlrs
since the beginning of 1986, Predergast said.
    ATT said it is required by the issues' terms to redeem
300,000 shares each year as well as providing for the optional
redemption of additional shares.
    The company said it will redeem 600,000 shares of the 3.64
dlrs preferred issue for 50 dlrs per share and 7.3 mln shares
of the issue for 50 dlrs per share plus a premium of 2.18 dlrs
per share.
    ATT said it will redeem each of the 3.74 dlrs preferred
shares 50 dlrs a share plus a premium of 2.35 dlrs a share.
    After the redemption, 600,000 shares of each issue will
remain outstanding, ATT said.
    ATT said it will select the redeemable shares by lot
according to the issues' terms, adding that the record date for
determining the redeemable shares will be March 26, 1987.
    The company said it will pay the May 1 dividend for all
preferred shares, including those being redeemed, in a normal
way to shareholders of record as of March 31, 1987.
    ATT said no transfer of the shares being called for
redemption will be made after March 26, 1987 and the transfer
books will close for those shares on that date.
    American Transtech Inc, the paying agent for the shares, 
will send notices of the redemption on March 30 to the
preferred shareholders who were selected by lot, ATT said.

<title>TEXACO <TX> CONFIRMS TEXAS COURT FILING</title>
<dateline>    WHITE PLAINS, N.Y., April 7 - </dateline>Texaco Inc said it filed a
petition in the Texas Court of Appeals for relief of the bond
and lien provisions of the 10.3 billion dlr judgement in its
legal dispute with Pennzoil Co <PZL>.
    Earlier today, a lawyer for Pennzoil told Reuters a filing
had been made in the Texas court of Appeals.
    "The petition asks the court to determine a reasonable
security arrangement between Texaco and Pennzoil," Texaco said
in a statement.
    Texaco also said it asked the court for a temporary
restraining order against Pennzoil's enforcement of the 10.3
billion dlr judgement until the petition is resolved.
    According to Texas law, Texaco could be forced to post the
full amount of the judgement as a bond. If it fails to do so,
Pennzoil could seek liens against Texaco's assets for the full
amount of the judgement.
    Yesterday the U.S. Supreme Court stuck down a lower federal
court ruling which had cut Texaco's bond to one billion dlrs.
It said the issue should first be considered in Texas state
Courts.
    Earlier, the attorney for Pennzoil said Texaco had
suggested a bond of one to 1.5 billion dlrs as a reasonable
amount in today's filing.
    But a Texaco spokesman had no immediate comment on the
figure.

    The company said the board's approval included the
dismissal of a protest by the Baltimore-based Maryland Alliance
for Responsible Investing against NCNB's performance under the
Community Reinvestment Act.
   
    The company said Maryland Alliance wanted the merger
blocked on the grounds that NCNB inadequately served the credit

its markets.
    The company said it denied the claim.

<title>ECUADOREAN UNIONS TO CALL GENERAL STRIKE</title>
<dateline>    Quito, march 18 - </dateline>ecuador's union federations called a
general strike for next wednesday to press the governent to
suspend austerity measures adopted recently to grapple with
losses from a recent earthquake.
    The 500,000-strong unitary workers' front (fut) and the
100,000-member general union of workers (ugt) have protested
the measures, which include a rise in petrol prices of up to 80
per cent and budget cuts of as much as 10 per cent.
    President leon febres cordero imposed the measures after a
march 5 earthquake cost an estimated one billion dollars in
losses. About 1,000 people are dead or missing.
    The leftist-led fut said it was also backing a call by the
maoist popular movement for democracy (mpd) party, to have
congress impeach and oust febres cordero, a conservative, for
having adopted the austerity measures.
    Congress needs to muster two-thirds of the votes in the
71-seat congress to censure and oust the president, whose
four-year presidential term ends in august 1988.
    The congress last january 22 voted 38-29 to approve a
non-binding resolution asking the president to resign for
having allegedly violated laws and provoking his 12-hour
abduction by air force paratroopers on january 16.

<title>HEINZ INTERESTED IN BUYING GUINNESS BREWING</title>
<dateline>    DUBLIN, March 3 - </dateline>H.J. Heinz <HNZ.N> chairman Tony O'Reilly
would be interested in buying Guinness PLC <GUIN.L>'s brewery
division if it were for sale, a spokesman said.
    The spokesman, reacting to Irish and British press reports,
said "He continues to be interested were the group to offer the
brewery side of Guinness for sale. But he has not put together
a consortium, nor has he been buying shares."
    He was quoted by the Irish magazine Business and Finance as
saying he would be interested if it came on the market and that
he had the support of two international banks if he decided
such a purchase might be worthwhile.
    In the magazine article, he suggested that if brewing
profits were calculated to be in the region of 80 mln punts,
the asking price would not be higher than 800 mln punts.
    "A multiple of ten times earnings would be the top whack for
the brewing division in the current Guinness situation," he
said.
    "This would mean an expensive exercise, right on the edge,
but not impossible," he added.
    The deal would mean buying the Dublin, London, Nigerian and
Malaysian breweries because "It could only be sold as an
integral unit if it was going to be sold at all," O'Reilly said.

<title>EC WHEAT RELEASE UNLIKELY TO SATISFY U.K. DEMAND</title>
<author>    By Kenneth Brettell, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, April 3 - </dateline>The European Commission's decision to
release an additional 300,000 tonnes of British intervention
feed wheat for the home market will provide only moderate
relief in an increasingly tight market, traders said.
    Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage,
pointing out that at this week's U.K. Intervention tender the
market sought to buy 340,000 tonnes but only 126,000 tonnes
were granted.
    The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely to
satisfy demand, they said, and keen buying competition for
supplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm.
    The release of the feed wheat followed recent strong
representations by the U.K. Grain trade to the Commission.
There has been growing concern that rising internal prices,
triggered by heavy exports, were creating areas of shortage in
interior markets.
    The latest EC authorisation will add 70,000 tonnes at the
April 14 tender and a further 30,000 tonnes later in the month.
The remaining 200,000 tonnes will be made available in May and
June.
    News of the release produced an early downward reaction in
local physical markets, but by midday some sections had halved
early two stg losses while others were unchanged.
    Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 1.85 mln
tonnes of wheat and 1.74 mln tonnes of barley remain in the
free market. However, some traders believe these figures are
overstated and, while some may still be held on the farm, the
bulk of wheat is already sold. Some of the grain is also off
the market in futures stores.
    A total of 2.10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has been
sold for export or to the home market since the season started
July 1, leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1.59
mln tonnes.
    Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1.0 mln
tonnes, leaving about 753,000 tonnes, traders said.
    This season's U.K. Export performance has surpassed all
early expectations and has created the present nervous
situation in domestic markets where the fear now is free market
supplies may not last out until new crop becomes available in
August.
    The market is sticking to its recent prediction of total
barley and wheat exports of around 10.5 mln tonnes, a new
record and nearly double the previous record of 5.9 mln tonnes
achieved in the 1984/85 season.
    Traders expect U.K. Wheat exports to reach 6.0 mln and
barley around 4.50 mln tonnes.
    The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2.5 mln
tonnes of British wheat and barley this season, but only 1.28
mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25, traders
said.
    Other EC countries have bought large amounts of British
grain and for the July 1/March 25 period had taken 2.59 mln
tonnes of wheat and 2.06 mln tonnes of barley. This compares
with 1.28 mln and 868,700 tonnes last season.
    The market is expecting prices, particularly wheat, to stay
buoyant for the remaining few months of the season. If supplies
become more difficult and prices strengthen further, feed
compounders may increase cereal substitute usage, traders said.

<title>AMR <AMR> AIRCRAFT FINANCING SEEN POSITIVELY</title>
<author>    By Steven Radwell, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 3 - </dateline>The deal AMR Corp cut to buy 40 new
planes is a plus for the company because it clearly puts the
financial burden on aircraft manufacturers Boeing Co <BA> and
<Airbus Industrie>, a European consortium, analysts said.
    "The terms put most of the risk on the shoulders of the
manufacturers," said analyst Kevin Murphy of Morgan Stanley and
Co. "They're called walkaway leases."
    AMR agreed to buy 15 planes from Boeing and 25 from Airbus
but said its American Airlines unit will lease the aircraft,
which essentially will be owned by the manufacturers.
    AMR declined to value the deal, which analysts estimated at
roughly 2.4 billion dlrs. American Airlines will use the
planes, scheduled for delivery in 1988 and 1989, to expand its
service in the Caribbean and to Europe.
    But AMR will not lay out cash deposits to pay for the
planes, nor will it take on new debt to finance the purchases.
The carrier has 20-year leases on the aircraft, with four-year
extension options, and may cancel the leases with 30 days
notice by paying a small penalty, according to AMR chairman
Robert Crandall.
    "We're getting the aircraft on very favorable terms,"
Crandall told a press briefing here. He called the deals "off
balance sheet" limited obligation leases, under which the
financing is provided by the manufacturers.
    A spokesman for Airbus confirmed those terms. "We will own
the aircraft and they will be leasing them from us," he said.
Airbus is providing American Airlines with 25 of its twin-jet,
long-range A300-600 planes.
    A spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplane Co, the unit of
Boeing that makes the long-range 767-300 planes that are part
of the deal, declined to comment on financing arrangements.
    Analysts said "walkaway lease" deals have been used before
by airlines buying aircraft, particularly new generations of
planes, but not to this extent.
    Julius Maldutis of Salomon Brothers Inc said the deal will
give AMR financial stability as it grows. "AMR is using the
manufacturers' balance sheets to finance these airplanes and
consequently, its debt to equity ratio will remain stable into
the early 1990s," he said.
    "The deal reflects a fundamental trend where airlines will
increasingly become operators of assets rather than owners" to
reduce their exposure to risk, he added.

<title>NYSE CHAIRMAN SAYS MARKET DECLINE NOT A CRASH</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, Oct 19 - </dateline>New York Stock Exchange chairman John
Phelan said the stock market underwent a significant correction
today but he did not characterize it as a crash. He also said
the NYSE will open tomorrow on time.
    "The market underwent a significant fall and a significant
devaluation of assets of which we are all concerned," he said.
    Speaking to reporters, Phelan listed several reasons why
the market fell today. He said stocks have been going up for
five years without a correction. He also blamed inflation
fears, rising interest rates, a lower dollar and problems with
Iran. "All came together in a very nervous market" he said.
    "It's the nearest thing to a meltdown that I ever want to
see," Phelan said. Phelan said what he meant by meltdown was a
snowballing effect where selling fed on itself.
    Phelan said the NYSE is going through its standard
procedures before trading begins tomorrow. Those procedures
include checking with member firms on their liquidity, margin
positions, and backlog. "We know of no firm that has a
significant problem, but that could change at any moment," he
said.
    Asked for advice for the average investor, Phelan said, "We
do not know where the market will end up."
    The Dow Jones Industrial average declined a record 508
points to 1738.74. Volume was a record setting 605 mln shares,
almost double the previous record.
    Phelan, in response to a question on declines in foreign
markets, said he believes there is no loss of confidence in the
global economy. He added that the underlying fundamentals of
the U.S. economy are still strong, and that corporate earnings
also continue to be firm.
    Phelan explained today's record descent as being the result
of a confluence of factors, including the globalization of
markets and the proliferation of new securities instruments.
    Those two factors alone have made the market more volatile,
he said.
    Phelan also said a major factor in the decline was the fact
that there has been no major correction in the five-year bull
market. He also pointed to rising tension in the Mideast Gulf.
    The New York Stock Exchange was in constant contact with
the Securities and Exchange Commission about a possible halt in
all trading on the exchange, Phelan said. "The consensus was
that it is better to let the market try to work itself out," he
said.
    In addition, Phelan said that with the global nature of
trading there is no guarantee that halting trading on the New
York Stock Exchange would have served any purpose. Phelan said
he was in contact with the Treasury department, White House and
the Federal Reserve, but that the contact was made as a matter
of routine.

<title>BRAZIL PLANS NEW ECONOMIC STRATEGY FOR GROWTH</title>
<dateline>    BRASILIA, March 25 - </dateline>Brazil is preparing a new economic
strategy intended to protect domestic growth, Finance Ministry
sources said.
    A presidential spokesman said President Jose Sarney had
authorised the government's economic team to prepare the new
plan as soon as possible.
    Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said last night the plan
would reflect "an important battle to protect the country's
development and keep it from recession."
    Funaro, who helped lead the anti-inflation Cruzado Plan
launched in February 1986, has come under increasing attack
over the past few days following the resignation of Planning
Minister Joao Sayad on March 17. Observers say the plan has
failed to stabilise the country's economy.
    Sayad submitted a new package calling for a 90-day prices
and a wage freeze, but met opposition from Sarney and Funaro.
    Foreign Ministry sources said the new strategy was being
prepared by economists Persio Arida and Andre Lara Resende,
both former Central Bank officials said to have played leading
roles in the Cruzado Plan.
   The new plan will define the terms on which Brazil will seek
rescheduling of its 109 billion dlr foreign debt.
    On February 20, Brazil suspended servicing of 70 billion
dlrs of debt to private foreign banks.
    Funaro said last night Brazil wants a rescheduling program
spread over four years, and added that it had to include new
loans to keep the domestic economy growing.
    "In the past two years Brazil paid 24 billion dlrs in
servicing of its foreign debt, while only getting two billion
dlrs in new loans," Funaro said.

<title>SENATORS, PROSECUTOR DISAGREE ON IRAN TESTIMONY</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 11 - </dateline>Senators and a special prosecutor
were in dispute today over a legal maneuver to force quick
answers from key figures in the Iran arms scandal and the
diversion of profits to Nicaraguan rebels.
    Senators on a special Senate committee investigating the
scandal want to grant limited immunity from prosecution to
force early testimony from Lt. Col. Oliver North and John
Poindexter.
    North is the National Security Council (NSC) aide President
Reagan fired November 25 for possibly illegal diversion of Iran
arms payments to the so-called contra rebels. Poindexter, who
was NSC director and North's boss, resigned the same day. 
    The Washington Post said over the weekend that Poindexter
was ready to testify that he told Reagan twice of the funds
diversion, contrary to Reagan's denial that he knew of it.
    Special prosecutor Lawrence Walsh said he asked a special
House committee yesterday to delay limited immunity for North
and Poindexter for at least 90 days, and would make the same
request to the Senate committee today.
    Walsh said he was also urging the committees to delay
granting immunity for a third key figure, retired Air Force
Maj. Gen. Richard Secord, a close North associate.
    Walsh, whose job is to determine whether anyone should be
prosecuted for criminal misconduct, said premature immunity
could put the three beyond the law before a grand jury can
decide whether they should be prosecuted.

<title>ECUADOR GETS LOAN TO HELP REPAIR OIL PIPELINE</title>
<dateline>    CARACAS, March 19 - </dateline>The Andean Development Corp (CAF) said
today it is lending 11.7 mln dlrs to Ecuador to help repair 25
miles of oil pipeline destroyed by an earthquake earlier this
month.
    the loan was signed here today in the offices of the
caracas based caf by the corporation's president, galo montano
perez and ecuadorean ambassador antonio parra gil.
    the loan had originally been intended to finance an
expansion of the pipeline, but following the earthquake the
ecuadorean government asked for the terms to be changed so as
to permit their use in reconstruction.
    Ecuador expects oil production to be suspended for four
months as a result of the damage, and has asked Venezuela to

<title>OECD AGREES EXPORT CREDIT REFORMS</title>
<dateline>    PARIS, March 17 - </dateline>The western industrialised nations have
agreed reforms in rules by which they provide credit for
exports to developing countries, the Organisation for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) said.
    The reforms tighten the rules for the use of foreign aid to
subsidise export credits in so-called "mixed credits," the OECD
said.
    The agreement, to be implemented in two stages in July this
year and July 1988, means the minimum aid component in mixed
credits will be raised to 35 pct from 25 pct, and to 50 pct for
credits covering exports to the world's least developed
nations.
    Additionally, a new formula will be used for calculating
the aid element in mixed credits, to take account of different
interest rates in the exporting countries, the 24-nation OECD,
which hosted the reform negotiations, said.
    Minimum interest rates for officially subsidised trade
loans have also been revised with the aim of cutting the
subsidies, and ending them completely on loans to relatively
rich developing countries by July next year.
    The reforms follow several years of pressure by the U.S. To
stop competitors, notably France and Japan, using foreign aid
to subsidise exports, putting U.S. Firms at a disadvantage.
    OECD officials said the agreement was based on a
provisional accord reached in January subject to ratification
by member governments. Some governments, including Austria, had
linked their final approval to other trade credit issues which
would be discussed at a meeting here in mid-April, they added.
    By raising the minimum amount of aid required in mixed
credits the agreement aims to make such hidden subsidies too
costly for frequent use.
    "A major loophole in the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade has been closed today," a senior U.S. Official here
commented.

<text>
<title>GLAXO <GLX> STOCK OFF ON ULCER REPORT</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 18 - </dateline>Shares of Glaxo Holdings PLC fell
following a report in today's New England Journal of Medicine
that antibiotics may be able to treat ulcers, threatening 
Glaxo's billion dlr antiulcer drug Zantac, analysts said.
    Glaxo's was trading at 27-7/8, off 1/2, on volume of
1,786,800 shares. Shares of SmithKline Beckman <SKB>, maker of
the popular anti-ulcer drug Tagamet, also fell 7/8 to 60-1/4.
    "Anything that raises the possiblity of an entirely new
therapy for ulcers would attack the core of Glaxo's worldwide
business, which is Zantac," said David MacCallum, an analyst
who follows Glaxo for Hambrecht and Quist.
   
    Zantac is the world's most prescribed drug with annual
sales of over one billion dollars, accounting for almost 75 pct
of Glaxo's earnings, said MacCallum.
    "If there is any perception that Zantac is not the therapy
of choice for ulcers, Glaxo's sales and profits could decline,"
said Tina Rizopuolos, an analyst with Alexanders Laing and
Or'kshnk.
    Rizopuolos said the New England Journal article, led by a
University of Toronto researcher, concludes from a study of 71
children with gastric disease that bacteria could cause
gastritis and ulcers.
   
    In an editorial in the same issue of the medical journal,
Richard Hornick of the University of Rochester School of
Medicine, reviewed studies using antibiotics to treat ulcers.
Rizopuolos said Hornick concludes that the bacteria ulcer
relationship is "exciting and intriguing," but further studies
are needed to show a direct causal effect.
    Ulcers happen when the stomach's protective lining erodes
and is exposed to underlying inflamed tissue, but it is unknown
what actually causes the process.
   
It is known that stomach acids exacerbate ulcers and therefore
antacids were commonly used to alleviate ulcers before Tagamet
and Zantac came along. Both of these drugs prevent the release
of the hormone histamine in the stomach, which triggers acid
secretion.
    "I don't think people should run out and sell Glaxo," said
analyst Rizopuolos. "It will take a long time to displace
Tagamet and Zantac...those drugs are going to be prescribed by
physicians for a long time," she added.

<title>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TELECOM IS KEY JAPAN MINISTRY</title>
<author>    By Linda Sieg, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 9 - </dateline>Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force
to be reckoned with, political analysts said.
    MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S.
And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of
a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians,
they said.
    "The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of
a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information,"
said one diplomatic source.
    "They are a potent political force," the diplomatic source
said.
    But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not
always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts
said.
    "The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not
so internationalized," said Waseda University professor Mitsuru
Uchida. "Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world
community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to
face the situation."
    Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with
London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep
a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in
Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business.
    The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival
groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one
competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now
monopolizes the business.
    It has also opposed a major management role in the planned
merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on
the grounds that no such international precedent exists.
    The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has
threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger
plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open
its telecommunications market.
    Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it
says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car
telephone and satellite communications market.
    Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the
sector it regulates.
    "What has been happening is an important shift in the
economy which makes the ministry a very important place," said
James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory
Service Inc.
    A decision to open the telecommunications industry to
competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted
rather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said.
    "With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto
legal framework," said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell
Whitten.
    Close links with the powerful political faction of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime
Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the
analysts said.
    "Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka
faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance
of MPT," Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of
the influential political group, he added.
    The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to
the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the
Postal Savings System, analysts said.
    MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate
interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial
liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal
Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than
banks, they said.
    Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's
obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized
the ministry as feudal.
    Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting
competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its
wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest
price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.
    But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of
its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world
including Britain, several analysts said.
    "The United States is really the odd man out," Abegglen said.
"For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order
in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable
view," he said.

<dateline>    CARACAS, March 11 - </dateline>Ecuador's deputy energy minister
Fernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks on
further Venezuelan assistance to his country's oil industry
following last week's earthquake, officials said.
    Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for an
expected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles of
pipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port of
Balao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports.
    Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lend
Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, to be repaid in kind after
180 days, to help meet its domestic consumption needs.

<title>AMERICAN CAN <AC> SEES HIGHER YEAR NET</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK , March 20 - </dateline>American Can Co chairman Gerald Tsai
said the company will record higher earnings in the first
quarter and for the full year.
    Addressing analysts, Tsai said "First quarter results have
been extremely encouraging and results for all of 1987 will
show significant improvement over 1986."
    American Can earned 196.3 mln dlrs, or 3.21 dlrs per share,
adjusted for a two-for-one stock split, in 1986.
    In the 1986 first quarter, the company reported net income
of 67.5 mln dlrs, including one-time gains from sale of assets,
or 2.30 dlrs per share, before the stock adjustment.
    In the 1987 first quarter, American Can will record a
one-time gain of 28 cts per share from the sale of shares in
its Musicland Group subsidiary. The gain is slightly higher
than the expected gain the company predicted in February
because additional shares of the unit were sold.
    In response to a question, Tsai said American Can's
investment in Jefferies and Co is "very small".
    "We treat it as just another passive investment," he said.
According to press reports, American Can owns 20 pct of
Jefferies and is its largest single shareholder.
    Yesterday, Boyd Jefferies, chairman and founder of the
brokerage firm bearing his name, resigned from the firm and
said he would plead guilty to two felony charges for breaking
securities laws.
    Responding to another question, Tsai said AIDS-related
claims were a small portion of claims made with American Can's
insurance subsidiaries in 1986.

<title>UNILEVER HAS IMPROVED MARGINS, VOLUMES IN 1986</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, MARCH 3 - </dateline>Unilever Plc <UN.A> and NV group reported
improvements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of
five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling
prices, disposals and currency movements, Unilever Plc chairman
Michael Angus said.
    He told reporters that volumes in North America increased
some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct
after being flat for some years.
    Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentrating
activities on core businesses, had now been completed, he
noted.
    But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategic
acquisitions taking place "from time to time," he said.
    The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax
profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously.
In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level dropped
three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion.
    Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc
<CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any
earnings dilution.
    However, it would not add much to profits, with much of the
company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs.
    Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing
- debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986
from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about
40 pct by end-1987.
    The same divergence was made in full year dividend, with
Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever
Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line with
the change in attributable profit.
    Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of
Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he said
that there was no target date for completing the process.
    He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to
realise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough had
paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, which
operates outside Unilever's core activities.
    In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business,
considerable expansion in the household products business and
in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase.
    However, he noted that the U.S. Household products business
had turned in a planned loss, with fourth quarter performance
better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs
of its Surf detergents.

    The company blamed the loss on the continuing depression in

    The Canadian government today said Ottawa would continue to
apply a duty of 84.9 cents per bushel on U.S. corn imports.
    Lyng said the U.S. made a case that U.S. corn imports are
not the cause of any problem of Canadian corn producers, adding
that U.S. corn exports to Canada are declining.
    "Apparently they (Canada) have ignored the fact that
Canadian corn and other coarse grain production is rising
faster than consumption," Lyng said.

<title>ENERGY/FOREIGN INVESTORS</title>
<author>    By JULIE VORMAN, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    HOUSTON, March 11 - </dateline>Lured by the weakening dollar and the
conviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound, European
energy companies are buying up cheap U.S. oil and gas reserves
to replenish their supplies, oil industry analysts said.
    They said owning oil reserves in a politically stable
United States is good insurance against future shortages.
However, the quick pace of foreign investment has heated up
competition among European firms, well-heeled U.S.
institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choice
domestic oil properties.
    Strevig and Associates, a Houston firm that tracks oil and
gas reserve sales, said growing interest among foreign buyers
had helped push reserve prices in recent months higher. All
buyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs a
barrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 for
acquisitions, up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and five
dlrs in the second quarter, according to the firm's research.
    "Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time, but
we're seeing new names and smaller companies coming in," said
Arthur Smith, an oil property appraisal specialist and
president of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich, Conn.
    "Europeans, especially, do not have much indigenous oil and
gas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries," he added.
    Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believe
the trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 because
of the fall in value of the U.S. dollar, the perception that
oil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper to
buy new reserves than to explore for them.
    Plenty of properties are available on the market, thanks to
the need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments and
general restructuring throughout the oilpatch.
    In two of the biggest transactions of recent months,
French-owned Minatome Corp., a unit of <Total Compagnie
Francaise des Petroles>, spent more than 230 mln dlrs to
separately acquire oil assets of Texas International <TEICC>
and Lear Petroleum Partners <LPP>. A spokesman for Minatome
said the company is searching for additional acquisitions.
    A partnership of two Belgian-owned firms, <Petrofina S.A.>
and <Cometra Oil S.A.> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buy
virtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos <WMB>,
the Oklahoma pipeline firm.
    But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventures
with experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil. Japan's
<Nippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Inc's <TX> Texaco USA in a
100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program, and has joined with
Dupont's <DD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal.
    Most buyers said the pay-back period of a property, its
geographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil are
more important factors in evaluating potential acquisitions
than relying on a simple price-per-barrel formula.
    Rich Hodges, a Houston-based land manager representing
International Oil and Gas Corp, a partnership of <Preussag
Corp> and <C. Deilmann Inc> of West Germany, said the firm had
earmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves in
Texas, Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months.
    But he called that a small amount compared to the amount
other investors have for acquisitions. PaineWebber's Geodyne
Energy Income Fund, for example, has said it plans to spend up
to 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties.
    "The competition is stiff, not only from other foreign
investors but from the brokerage houses and U.S. oil
companies," he said. "Our company is shopping around because we
feel it's substantially less risky than pure exploration. If
you're going to take the risk inherent in exploration, you need
prices higher than the current market," he added.
    In addition to the foreign investors and U.S. brokerage
houses, analysts said many of the major oil companies were also
competing for prime properties.
    Houston-based Shell Oil Co, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group
<RD>, has been one of the most active companies in buying and
selling reserves, Smith said. Since 1982, Shell has acquired
two billion dlrs in new reserves, including 470 mln barrels of
oil equivalent at a net cost of 2.80 dlrs a barrel, he said.
    "Buying reserves is a good strategy for most of these
companies," Smith said. "Domestic production has dropped by one
mln barrels a day because of cutbacks in drilling and it may
drop by another one mln barrels a day in 1988."

<title>CSR SELLING DELHI TO EXXON UNIT, DROPS DELHI FLOAT</title>
<dateline>    SYDNEY, March 31 - </dateline>CSR Ltd <CSRA.S> and Exxon Corp <XON>
unit <Esso Exploration and Production Australia Inc> said CSR
has agreed to sell its <Delhi Australia Fund> (DAF) to Esso for
985 mln Australian dlrs.
    The sale is effective from tomorrow, they said in a joint
statement.
    The previously announced float of part of its Delhi
interest will not now proceed, CSR said in the statement.
    Delhi Australia Fund owns <Delhi Petroleum Pty Ltd>, which
holds an average of 25 pct in the Santos Ltd <STOS.S>-led
Cooper and Eromanga Basin gas and liquids projects.
    In addition to the purchase price, CSR will share equally
in any returns due to increases in crude oil and condensate
prices over certain levels for liquids produced from Delhi's
interests in the next two years, the statement said.
    "The Esso proposal to purchase all the Delhi interest will
be more beneficial to our shareholders than proceeding with the
float," CSR chief executive Bryan Kelman said in the statement.
    Kelman said the sale of Delhi would enable CSR to focus
efforts on expanding business areas such as sugar and building
materials in which CSR has had long and successful management
experience and strong market leadership.
    With the sale, CSR will be able to expand those businesses
more aggressively and earlier, he said.
    As reported separately, soon after announcing the Delhi
sale CSR launched a takeover bid for the 68.26 pct of <Pioneer
Sugar Mills Ltd> that it does not already hold, valuing its
entire issued capital at 219.6 mln dlrs.
    After Bass Strait, the onshore Cooper and Eromanga Basin is
Australia's largest oil and gas producing area with current
gross oil production of 45,000 barrels per day (BDP), gas
liquids output of 30,000 BPD and gas sales of 480 mln cubic
feet a day, the CSR-Esso statement said.
    The purchase gives Esso, a 50/50 partner with The Broken
Hill Pty Co Ltd <BRKN.S> in the Bass Strait, its first onshore
production in Australia, they said.
    Esso's chairman Stuart McGill said he hoped Esso can assist
in maintaining the high rate of oil and gas discoveries in the
Cooper-Eromanga area.
    "These discoveries will help Australia's self-sufficiency in
oil reserves thereby offsetting in part the decline in Bass
Strait production now under way," McGill said.
    In a separately released letter to CSR shareholders, Kelman
said CSR was within days of completing plans for the float of
CSR Petroleum when it received an offer from Esso.
    He said CSR is convinced the sale was the correct decision
in view of the risks associated with the oil business.
    The price-sharing arrangement provides for CSR to share
equally with Esso in higher returns if oil prices average more
than 20 U.S. Dlrs a barrel in the next two years, he said.
    Kelman said a revaluation of CSR's investment in Delhi to
net realisable value as of today, CSR's annual balance-date,
will result in an extraordinary loss of 97 mln dlrs.
    However, revaluations and profits on sales of other assets
will significantly reduce this loss, he said.
    He also said that CSR is sufficiently encouraged by future
prospects and the opportunity to reposition the group in core
businesses to foreshadow an increase in final dividend payable
in July to 10 cents from nine to make an annual 19 cents
against 18 in 1985/86.

<title>U.S. CREDIT MARKETS END UNDER EXTREME PRESSURE</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 30 - </dateline>The U.S. credit market ended under
extreme pressure as the dollar's continued slide on the
currency markets triggered an avalanche of U.S. securities
sales, pushing prices to 1987 lows, dealers and analysts said.
    "This was a bloodbath," said one money market economist.
"We've been trading in a state of total panic at times today,"
said another.
    Mirroring the dollar's fall to a 40-year low against the
yen, the key 7-1/2 pct 30-year Treasury bond price fell nearly
two points to close at 96-7/32, compared with 98-5/32 on
Friday. The corresponding yield jumped to 7.83 pct from 7.66.

<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 13 - </dateline>Expiration dates on upland cotton
certificates issued under the 1986 upland cotton program are

    The certificates are being extended because of a shortage

said.
    Presently, upland cotton commodity certificates expire nine
months from the last day of the month of issuance.
    Under the new procedure, all current outstanding and all
new upland cotton certificates issued under the 1986 upland
cotton program will have an expiration date of either February
29, 1988, or nine months from the last day of the month in
which the certificate is issued, whichever is later.

<dateline>    THE HAGUE, June 18 - </dateline>Aid donors to Indonesia pledged a
total of 3.15 billion dlrs in fresh funds to Jakarta, a
statement issued after a two day meeting of the Inter
Governmental Group on Indonesia (IGGI) said.
    This compares with 2.6 billion dlrs allocated at last
year's meeting, the statement said. It is also well above the
World Bank's recommendation of 2.5 billion guilders in aid for
the coming year.
    "The Group commended Indonesia for having taken effective
steps to adjust to the changed economic environment," the
statement said.
    The statement said Indonesia must take further steps to set
the stage for resumed economic growth that could create
employment for the country's rapidly growing labour force.
    "These measures include additional significant trade and
industrial deregulation," the statement said.
    It also called for policies supporting efficient and
diversified growth of agriculture, and said Jakarta should give
more room to the private sector. It called on Indonesia to
mobilise more domestic resources to finance development
programs.

<title>ECUADOR TO PRODUCE ABOVE OPEC QUOTA - MINISTER</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, June 29 - </dateline>Ecuador will produce crude oil in excess
of its 221,000-bpd OPEC quota during the second half of this
year, Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a news
conference.
    Ecuador plans to produce 280,000 bpd in August, rising to
320,000 bpd next January, the minister said.
    "We will be producing more than the quota to pay off the
crude and products we have been lent by Venezuela, Nigeria and
Kuwait and to compensate for the crude we have been unable to
produce during the past few months," he said.
    Earthquake damage to a pipeline sharply cut Ecuadorean
production from March to May this year.
    Santos said the move had been explained to fellow OPEC
members during last week's meeting in Vienna, when an increase
in Ecuador's quota to 221,000 bpd from 210,000 was approved.
    "They understood our position and we believe we remain
within the spirit of the (quota) agreement," he said.
    Immediately before the March quake Ecuadorean production
was 250,000-260,000 bpd, with 144,000 bpd exported.
    While its production was down, Venezuela, Nigeria and
Kuwait loaned Ecuador a total 12 mln barrels of crude and four
mln barrels of products, Santos said.

<title>SEA CONTAINERS <SCR> EXPECTS BETTER FIRST QTR</title>
<dateline>    HAMILTON, Bermuda, March 19 - </dateline>Sea Containers Ltd predicted
its first quarter fiscal 1987 net earnings would improve by 10
mln dlrs over the same period a year ago.
    The company said 1987 got off on a much better footing than
fiscal 1986, from which the company recorded a loss of 67.6 mln
dlrs, or 6.28 dlrs per share, on revenues of 641.4 mln dlrs.
    James Sherwood, president of the company, said he expects
to record a loss of approximately 12 mln dlrs for the first
quarter, compared to losses of approximately 22 mln dlrs for
first quarter fiscal 1986.
    The company emphasized the first quarter is a traditionally
slow period for the ferry industry, which is  part of Sea
Containers' business.
    Sherwoood said the company's losses were largely
attributable to non-recurring events and provisions. He cited
the default of 15 container leasees and ship charterers,
costing the company approximately 25 mln dlrs.
    He also cited a 23 mln dlr cost as a result of a closing
two of its subsidiary's ferry services, and a 10.3 mln dlr
provision to cover losses on the sale of container assets and
severance pay costs.

<title>REAGAN VOWS TO BLOCK TAX HIKE IN HIS PRESIDENCY</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 13 - </dateline>President Reagan told a group of
supporters his pledge to veto a tax hike is solid, adding,
"There will be no tax rate increase in the 100th Congress."
    While he did not mention House Speaker Jim Wright by name,
Reagan said that some members of Congress were urging that
taxes be raised.
    "I'm sorry but that's just not going to happen," said Reagan.
"We're not going to break faith with the American people."
    "I promise you, tax reform will go ahead as scheduled," the
president added. "All these tax hike schemes have as much chance
of flying as a dead duck," he said.
    Reagan combined his strongly-stated opposition to a tax
hike with a warning to Congress to meet the deficit reduction
targets set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget control law.
    Failure to do so, he said, would jeopardize a continuation
of the current favorable economic climate.

<title>JURY FINDS FOR DOW <DOW> IN BIRTH DEFECT CASE</title>
<dateline>    PHILADELPHIA, Feb 26 - </dateline>Dow Chemical Co's <DOW> Merrell Dow
Pharmaceuticals Inc unit said a jury found that Bendectin did
not cause the birth defects of a seven-year old boy whose
mother took the drug during pregnancy.
    The anti-nausea drug has been used to treat morning 
sickness and was discontinued in 1983 amid allegations that the
drug caused birth defects.
    Merrell said that to date there have been 12 other trials
involving the drug, 10 in the U.S. and two in West Germany.
    It said verdicts or judgements in favor of the company were
obtained in eight of the trials, one of which included about
1,150 plaintiffs.
    In two trials, Merrell said, verdicts were in favor of the
plaintiffs. In one, it said, the trial judge overruled the
jury's verdict and issued a judgement in favor of the company
and a three judge panel of the Court of Appeals overturned the
trial judge's ruling. Merrell is now awaiting a rehearing of
this case by the full Court of Appeals.
    Of the remaining two trials, one ended in a mistrial and in
the other the jury was unable to reach a verdict.
    At one point about 1700 lawsuits had been filed alleging
the drug caused birth defects, said a company spokesman. He
said about 300 lawsuits are pending.
    Bendectin was first introduced in the early 1950s, and the
Merrell spokesman said a valid application to make and market
the drug is with the Food and Drug Administration should the
company decide it wants to reintroduce it.

<title>CHEMICAL <CHL> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, EXPENSES</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </dateline>Chemical New York Corp said its
first-quarter profits fell by 16 pct, largely because it placed
1.04 billion dlrs of loans to Brazil on non-accrual.
    Chemical reported first-quarter net income of 86.2 mln
dlrs, down from 102.6 mln a year earlier, but declaring the
Brazilian loans non-performing cost Chemical 21 mln dlrs in
lost interest income, or 12 mln dlrs after-tax.
    A 13.3 pct jump in non-interest expense to 471.3 mln dlrs
from 415.9 mln also hit the bottom line. It said the rise was
mainly due to staff costs associated with continued growth in
consumer, capital markets and investment banking activities.
    Excluding the effect of placing Brazil on non-accrual,
Chemical said its net income would have been 98.2 mln dlrs, or
4.3 pct below 1986 earnings.
    Brazil suspended interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of
medium- and long-term debt on February 20. If they are not
resumed by year's end, Chemical said its after-tax net for the
whole of 1987 will be reduced by about 51 mln dlrs.
    Chemical also placed 52 mln dlrs of loans to Ecuador on
non-accrual because the Quito government also suspended
interest payments on its foreign debt. This reduced interest
income by 1.5 mln dlrs.
    Chemical said net interest income fell to 476.4 mln dlrs
from 488.9 mln and its net spread narrowed to 3.61 pct from
3.96 pct.
    This reflected the reclassification of Brazilian loans, a
reduced federal income tax rate (which affected the calculation
of the taxabale-equivalent adjustment on tax-exempt assets) and
a narrowing of the spread between the prime rate and Chemical's
cost of funds.
    Foreign exchange trading profits rose to 37.9 mln dlrs from
27.0 mln, but bond trading profits dropped to 21.9 mln dlrs
from 26.2 mln.
    Fees from trust and other banking services rose to 146.5
mln dlrs from 129.3 mln a year earlier, Chemical said.
    The provision for loan losses was 87.2 mln dlrs, compared
with 83.8 mln. Net loan charge-offs were 86.5 mln, up from 60.7
mln, leaving the allowance for loan losses at 672.6 mln dlrs at
quarter's end, or 1.74 pct of loans outstanding, compared with
594.3 mln, or 1.50 pct, a year earlier.
    Non-accruing loans at the end of March were 2.39 billion
dlrs (1.35 billion excluding Brazil), compared with 1.35
billion at the end of 1986 and 1.22 billion at the end of
March, 1986.

<title>SAUDI SUCCESS SEEN IN CURBING OPEC PRODUCTION</title>
<dateline>    HOUSTON, March 3 - </dateline>Saudi Arabia will succeed in pressuring
other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries to stay within their production quotas, said Morgan
Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer.
    Wellemeyer, speaking to reporters at an offshore oil
engineering conference, also said he expected OPEC nations to
attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years
to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong.
    "Over the next few weeks I think you'll see a concerted
effort by the Saudis to get production down," Wellemeyer said.
    "The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs a
barrel) and are willing to make it happen again," he said.
    In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a
barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing
above their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln
barrels per day. But prices rebounded today, with April U.S.
crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a
belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output.
    Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production
could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as
early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993.
    Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil
should strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed the
organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a
barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from
switching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing market
accounts for about eight mln barrels a day, or 18 pct of the
world demand for oil.

<title>AUSTRALIA LEADING INDEX CONTINUES RISE IN DECEMBER</title>
<dateline>    MELBOURNE, March 11 - </dateline>Westpac Banking Corp and the
Melbourne University Institute of Applied Economic and Social
Research said their leading index of Australian economic
activity rose for the ninth successive month in December.
    The index rose to 134.1 (base 1980) from 129.8 in November
and 122.8 a year earlier, the Westpac-Institute report said.
    Annualised, it rose 13 pct in December against seven pct in
November and one pct a year earlier, based on the ratio of the
latest index to the average over the previous 12 months.
    The report said the index is now 12 points or 9.8 pct above
its trough in March 1986.
    Westpac's chief economist Bob Graham said the consistent
upward trend in the leading index emphasised the need for a
tough mini-budget in May. "An untoward increase in consumption
spending before the balance of payments improves would have
disastrous consequences," he said.
    The coincident index also rose an annualised three pct in
December against zero movement in November and a seven pct rise
a year earlier, Westpac and the Institute said.
    They said this index continued to show the current
recession is shallow and is more likely to involve a slowing in
real growth than an absolute fall in economic activity.

<title>DUTCH SUGAR TRADE DENY INVOLVEMENT IN OFFER</title>
<dateline>    ROTTERDAM, March 12 - </dateline>Dutch sugar traders deny involvement
in a plan to offer more than 850,000 tonnes of sugar to
intervention in protest at EC export policy and prices, traders
told Reuters.
    Although some 2,500 tonnes of sugar have been offered to
intervention in the Netherlands, Dutch producers and traders
said this sugar was actually Belgian and was being offered by
the Belgian industry.
    "We sympathise with the actions of the French, West German
and Belgian traders and producers, but we are not party to it,"
a spokesman said.
    EC Commission sources said yesterday French traders planned
to sell 775,000 tonnes into intervention stocks, West German
traders 75,000 tonnes and Dutch traders 2,500. Dutch trade
sources gave the same figure for France, but estimated up to
110,000 tonnes offered by German traders and producers.
    The Dutch spokesman added, "The weekly export tender policy
and prices are squeezing the European sugar industry, and this
is the only way in which they can really register their
protest.
    "These are desperate actions, but we believe that most of
this offered sugar will be withdrawn within the three-week
breathing space allowed."

<dateline>    PEKING, March 24 - </dateline>China's fifth securities market will
open on April 1 in the industrial port city of Tianjin, the
People's Daily overseas edition said.
    It said the market will in its first phase trade four
bonds, two issued by banks, one by a well-known city bicycle
factory and one issued by the city government to finance
construction of a road.
    Buyers and sellers can either agree on a price between them
and register the deal with the Industrial and Commercial Bank
that will run the new market or entrust the bank to make the
deal, it said.
    The paper said that only financial organisations and not
other firms or individuals could handle such trading.
    China's first securities market opened last year in the
northeast city of Shenyang and, since then, others have opened
in Shanghai, Peking and Harbin.

<title>DEBT SOLUTION REQUIRES OPEN MARKETS, GERMAN BANKER</title>
<dateline>    FRANKFURT, March 23 - </dateline>The solution of the world's debt
crisis requires open markets but a possible resurgence of
protectionism is the biggest danger, the president of the
Federal Association of German Banks, Wolfgang Roeller, said.
    Roeller, who is also management board spokesman of Dresdner
Bank AG, said in a radio interview it is unlikely Brazil's
suspension last month of part of its interest payments would
lead to a chain reaction in Latin America.
    It is important to increase the efficiency of debtor
countries to such an extent they earn sufficient currency from
exports to repay foreign debt, he said.
    Brazil had taken a unilateral step, Roeller said, but
Brazil had a strong and broad economic base. With the help of
appropriate economic programmes there should be a way to bring
back financial stability to that country.
    Roeller said action on the debt situation had to be taken
now. It could not be expected debtor countries would be able to
repay debts in the short run, even if economic conditions
improved. Programmes had to be developed which would strengthen
the economic position of these countries, to ensure world
economic growth so they are able to sell their products at
adequate prices.
    Roeller said the debt crisis could only be solved in
coordination with governments, international organisations such
as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and
creditor banks.
    "This is not a topic which can be solved by creditor banks
alone," he said. One aim had to be to raise the credit standing
of debtor countries to such a degree they are able to raise
funds on international credit markets again. He said a whole
set of new ideas had been developed and he was convinced the
international banking system would provide more funds, but the
problem is not just economic but also political.

<dateline>    TOKYO, March 27 - </dateline>Japan's Nissan Motor Co Ltd said it and
<Lancer Boss Group Ltd> of the U.K. Have agreed to cooperate on
the design and manufacture of forklift trucks.
    Under the accord, Lancer will start making jointly designed
trucks at its plant in Moosburg, West Germany, from July with
production reaching 300 three-wheeled and 100 four-wheeled
trucks by end-March 1988. Output will be doubled from April 1,
1988, a Nissan spokeswoman said.
    Nissan will start selling the three-wheelers under its
brand-name later this year and the four-wheelers from the end
of 1987, the company said.
    The equipment manufacturing agreement with Lancer is a
precaution against the European Community's (EC) January 1987
restriction on forklift truck exports to the EC, industry
sources said.
    Nissan exports 70 pct of its annual output of 16,000
forklift trucks, shipping 2,548 units to the EC in 1986, the
spokeswoman said.

<title>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN PUSHES ITS CHIPMAKERS</title>
<author>    By Linda Sieg, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 11 - </dateline>Japanese microchip makers are being
strong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact on
semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's
market to foreign chips, industry analysts said.
    But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuring
the firms, can successfully battle market forces and whether
the U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of any
breathing space, they said.
    U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September
have pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese
chipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said.
    "MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry
to get things done," said Bache Securities (Japan) associate
vice president Peter Wolffe.
    Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the
January to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive
chips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject
to the pact's price controls.
    The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide
distributors with certificates designating them as authorised
exporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which grey
marketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said.
    U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in
jeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American markets
and little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan.
    But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the
production cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corp
said it would cut production in line with MITI's request.
    "NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI's
demands," said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. "Once
NEC cuts production, it means they all have."
    Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanese
firms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales that
the Commerce Department assigns them under the pact.
    "The best way to lower cost is to produce more," said Salomon
Brothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec.
    Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also
spur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst Matt
Aizawa said.
    Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new
restrictions, some industry officials said.
    "It's like tax avoidance schemes," said Steve Donovan, head
of MMI Japan K.K. "As soon as you close one route, another
opens."
    MITI's pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earlier
shrugged off MITI guidance.
    "It's getting to be like communism," said one.
    But analysts said output cuts could help by making it
easier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcing
firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss.
    "They're going to have to start running their businesses
like businesses," Bache's Wolffe said.
    MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaign
urging chip users to buy foreign-made chips, but U.S. Industry
officials said response has been mixed at best.
    "There has been some change, but it's not across the board,"
said one U.S. Spokesman. "The companies have a varying degree of
urgency."
    The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on the
troubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added.
    Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamic
random access memory) chips could merely speed the transition
to one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said.
    Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memory
chips, or interested in doing so, also remains unclear, they
said.
    Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S.
Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing the
most advanced technology for microchip manufacturing.
    Even in the thorny area of access, much depends on U.S.
Commitment as well as on Japanese openness, some said.
    "The SIA (U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association) doesn't
even have an office here," a source close to the industry said.
"You could question just how committed they are."
    In addition, some industry analysts question the
effectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third
country chipmakers such as those in South Korea.
    "(South) Korea's gaining market share," said one analyst.
"They're the real winners from the agreement."

<title>U.S. CORN DEMAND GROWING IN JAPAN, SOUTH KOREA</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 11 - </dateline>The recent purchase of 1.5 mln
tonnes of U.S. corn by Japan and 600,000 tonnes by South Korea
suggests that the two countries' demand for reliable supplies
of corn is increasing, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.
    In its World Production and Trade Report, the department
said that view is reinforced by the expectation of a decline in
exportable supplies of Argentine corn and uncertainty over the
availability of South African and Chinese corn.
    With these corn purchases, Japan is committed to buying 7.7
mln tonnes of U.S. corn in 1986/87 (Sept-Aug), nearly 400,000
tonnes greater than year-ago figures to date.
    South Korea's cumulative commitments amount to 2.5 mln
tonnes, up 1.5 mln compared to last year, it said.

<title>WORLD BANK TEAMS STUDYING PHILIPPINE LOAN REQUESTS</title>
<author>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    MANILA, March 20 - </dateline>Two World Bank review teams are in the
Philippines to assess government requests for funding for an
expanded housing plan and an accelerated land reform program,
bank officials said.
    They told Reuters the housing program loan request is for
100 mln to 150 mln dlrs.
    The government has said it will ask for another 500 mln dlr
long-term loan from a World Bank-led consultative group of
multilateral and bilateral aid donors to partially fund its
land reform program.
    The officials said negotiations will start next month on
another 150 mln dlr loan sought by Manila to carry out reforms
in 14 major state-owned corporations.
    On Tuesday, the world bank approved two loans totalling 310
mln dlrs to help the country's economic recovery program.
    The bank was also studying Philippine proposals for loans
to finance geothermal and education projects, sources said.
    World Bank sources said the bank's lending to the
Philippines since 1957, including the latest loan, totalled 4.3
billion dlrs. The money has been spread out over more than 100
loans and about 1.2 billion dlrs remains undisbursed.
    The World Bank sources said the bank cancelled 450 mln dlrs
in loan commitments to the Philippines during the last three
years of President Ferdinand Marcos's rule. Marcos was toppled
by a military-civilian revolt in February 1986.
    "The loans were cancelled because the projects slated for
aid were not implemented properly," they said.
    The sources said the bulk of this week's loan would be used
to rehabilitate the state-owned Development Bank of the
Philippines (DBP) and the Philippine National Bank (PNB) which
are saddled with seven billion dlrs of non-performing assets.
    "At least 300 mln dlrs of previously cancelled loans were
supposed to go to the DBP," the World Bank sources said. "Over
the past three years the bank's disbursement pipeline to the
Philippines almost completely dried up."
    In 1986 alone, the two banks paid out 16 billion pesos in
loan repayments, about 59 pct of the government's budget
deficit of 27 billion pesos for the year, they said.
    Agreement on the latest loan was reached in principle last
September when President Corazon Aquino visited the U.S. The
sources said the loan was held up because of delays by the
government in submitting essential documents.
    The World Bank sources said the request for land reform
funding would be discussed at a meeting of the World Bank-led
consultative group to be held alongside the April 27-29 annual
meeting of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in Osaka.
    The government has said the land reform plan aims to
distribute 9.7 mln hectares of land to impoverished peasants.
    The sources said the Philippine government estimated the
entire program would cost 60 billion pesos. "About 27 billion is
long-term and will cover land transfer costs borne mainly by
landowners," they said. "The landowners will be paid in 10-year
bonds redeemable in ten instalments."
    The sources said the bulk of financing would cover
development costs for the land program and help to bridge the
gap between the 10-year spread of payments to landowners and a
proposed 30-year loan repayment period for land buyers.
    "If you include interest, the total amount of external
assistance needed annually should not exceed 200 mln dlrs," the
sources said. "That volume of aid does not appear difficult."
    They said Japan, the World Bank and the ADB are expected to
provide most of the financing while the Philippines' 12
bilateral aid donors would contribute the rest.
    The World Bank sources said lending to the Philippines is
designed to support its balance of payments position while the
government aims for a target of six to seven pct annual gross
national product growth.
    "Brazil did not do this homework," one said. "They pushed
ahead with a recovery program without ensuring backing for
their balance of payments position. Manila is being more
cautious and aims at soft borrowings which, it is hoped, will
be outstripped by annual growth rates and eventually result in
the country emerging from debt in five or six years."
    Philippine foreign debt is currently 27.8 billion dlrs.

<title><RANGE ROVER> TO SELL VEHICLES IN U.S.</title>
<dateline>    Detroit, March 4 - </dateline>Range Rover of North America Inc, a
subsidiary of the British Land Rover Group, said it would begin
selling the luxury utility vehicles in the United States March
16 at a suggested retail price of 30,825 dlrs.
    Range Rover executives told Reuters after a press
conference they expect to generate 80 mln dlrs in revenues this
year, but that the U.S. venture is not expected to become
profitable until 1989.
    The executives said they expect to sell 3,000 of the
vehicles this year from an initial network of 37 dealers, which
will be gradually expanded to 65 within a year.
    Range Rover's project, aimed at buyers with household
incomes above 100,000 dlrs annually, is the culmination of a
four-year effort by Land Rover Group to introduce the
British-build vehicle in the U.S. market.
    The executives said the only option to be offered with the
vehicles will be a leather upholstery package priced at 1,025
dlrs.

<title>EGYPT, SOVIET UNION TO RENEGOTIATE ARMS DEBT TERMS</title>
<dateline>    CAIRO, March 16 - </dateline>Egypt and the Soviet Union are expected
to sign an agreement in Moscow next week settling Cairo's three
billion dlr military debt, Egyptian officials said.
    One official, who asked to remain anonymous, told Reuters a
draft agreement would reduce to zero from two pct future
interest payable on the 10 year-old debt, and set a 25 year
repayment term.
    Talks are due to begin in Moscow on Wednesday.
    Economy Minister Youssri Mustapha, who leaves for Moscow on
Tuesday, met President Hosni Mubarak and Egyptian ambassador to
Moscow Salah Bassiouni to discuss the issue.
    One official said Egypt would propose a new exchange rate
for trade with the Soviet Union. Current commerce is based on a
rate set in the 1960s of 0.38 Egyptian pounds to the dollar
which Moscow sees as unreasonable. The fluctuating official
rate is about 1.36 pounds to the dollar.
    The officials said part of the debt would be paid in
exports of goods such as textiles, leather and furniture.
    Egypt wants to settle the debt problem partly to open the
door for new cooperation, mainly in modernising Soviet-built
steel, aluminium and fertiliser plants under a five-year
development plan ending June 30 1992.
    Egypt, which already imports Soviet coal, wood, newsprint
and glass, also wanted a debt deal to allow purchases of
currently blocked spare parts for its ageing Soviet military
hardware, the officials said.
    An estimated 65 pct of Egypt's arsenal is still made up of
Soviet-supplied equipment, one official said.
    Cairo stopped repaying Moscow for arms purchases in 1977
when then-president Anwar Sadat broke with its long-standing
ally and turned to the U.S..

<title>BEVERLY ENTERPRISES <BEV> DEBT LOWERED BY S/P</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </dateline>Standard and Poor's Corp said it
downgraded 225 mln dlrs of debt of Beverly Enterprises.
    Cut were the company's senior debt to BB-minus from BB and
subordinated debt to B-plus from BB-minus. The implied senior
secured debt rating is BB.
    S and P said the action reflected Beverly's aggressive
plans to repurchase stock that would increase financial risk
while earnings prospects become more clouded.
    Despite the planned use of proceeds from asset sales for a
portion of the buy back's costs, decapitalization would raise
adjusted debt leverage above the 75 pct level of recent years.

<title>ECUADOR UNABLE TO SERVICE DEBT - CENTRAL BANK</title>
<dateline>    Quito, march 13 - </dateline>ecuador cannot service its debt owed to
private foreign banks due to the earthquake that forced a
suspension of crude oil exports, central bank officials said.
    "we hope to obtain a tacit, explicit acceptance from foreign
banks ... that we are not able to service the debt," central
bank president carlos julio emanuel said.
    "the reality is that our debt service capacity has been
totally affected by the recent cataclysm," he added in a news
conference last night.
    A central bank spokesman said emanuel was referring to
payments owed private foreign banks, already suspended since
january. These banks hold two-thirds of the country's 8.16
billion dollar foreign debt.
    Emanuel was not refering to debts to foreign governments
and multilateral organisations, the spokesman said.
    The march 5 earthquake damaged an oil pipeline, preventing
crude exports for a projected five months. Oil generates about
two-thirds of ecuador's total exports and as much as 60 per
cent of the government's revenues.
    Emanuel did not specify how long ecuador would be unable
service private foreign banks. But finance minister domingo
cordovez said two days ago the government is seeking to
postpone all payments due to private foreign banks in 1987
until next year through negotiations with creditors.
    Emanuel said ecuador was seeking soft loans from
multilateral organisations for reconstruction work. It also
wanted a "reprogramming" of already-approved loans, an apparent
reference to the disbursement schedule of thee credits.

<dateline>    MORGANVILLE, N.J., March 16 - </dateline>The Business Journal of New
Jersey said it will publish Garden State Home and Garden
monthly, beginning in September.
    The company said the publication was launched as a
bi-monthly in November 1986. The decision to covert to a
monthly was made as a result of increasing demand for
advertising space in the first four issues.
    The company also said it expects 1987 revenues of about
three mln dlrs, continuing average growth of over 50 pct for a
second year.
    A spokesman declined to release actual 1986, stating the
company had not completed its 10K report. For the first nine
months of 1986, it had sales of 1,070,000 dlrs while sales for
all of 1985 were a little less than one mln dlrs, he added.

<title>FRANCE WILL FIGHT EC FARM PROPOSALS - MINISTER</title>
<dateline>    VERSAILLES, FRANCE, March 26 - </dateline>French Agricultural Minister
Francois Guillaume warned that France would flatly reject
proposed reforms of the European Community, EC, cereals, sugar
and oilseeds sectors, which he said would disrupt these
markets.
    The EC Commission's proposals to shorten the intervention
period and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase the
financial burden on the sugar producers will also result in
lower real prices for producers, he told farmers here.
    "I give you my word that France, while it will not reject
technical adjustments or serious discussion, will simply reply
in the negative to these bad reforms," Guillaume told the annual
conference of the country's major farm union, FNSEA 
(Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles).
    Community agricultural ministers are due to meet again
Monday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spiralling
EC output and fix farm prices for 1987/88.
    Relations between the government and farmers have become
strained in France in recent months.
    There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations by
farmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices and
further cutbacks in Community milk output.
    But Guillaume's warning that he would reject reorganisation
of the EC cereal and sugar markets -- France being a major
producer of both crops -- won him warm applause from the
FNSEA's farmers.
    His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for the
complete dismantling of the system of cross border taxes
designed to smooth out currency differences known as Monetary
Compensatory Amounts, MCA's, however, are unlikely to avoid
further protests by producers.
    Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to go
ahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroad
against the EC Commission's proposals to overhaul the farm
sector.
    "The Minister's proposals back up our determination to
organise union action in the coming weeks," he told reporters,
adding that this could also act in Guillaume's favour on a
ministerial level.
    Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before being
appointed farm minister last spring.
    Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt that
Guillaume was doing a good job as farm minister.
    There have been certain advances on cutting production
costs, reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid, but
there are still areas where more could be done such as on
farmers' indebtedness, he said.
    Guillaume told the conference the government will make
available 2.4 billion francs (396 mln dlrs) to help producers
reduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire.
    The government has already announced financial aid for the
milk sector and it was not clear how much of the package
announced today was new aid, Lacombe said.

<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 19 - </dateline>U.S. Budget Director James Miller
said President Reagan would veto the Democrat-controlled
Congress' new budget plan out of hand -- but offered to
compromise on raising revenues.
    "If that budget comes down it will vetoed out of hand, I can
tell you that," Miller said on a morning television show.
    He said Reagan would not accept the 19 bln dlr tax increase
in Congress' proposal but said "keep in mind the president has
proposed certain revenues in his budget.
    "They're not taxes," Miller said. "They are user charges and
asset sales. I think there is some room there we can sit down
and talk with the Democrats about."
    Miller said he believed a compromise could be worked out
but he said the administration would need assurance that
whatever compromise it accepted would indeed by passed by
Congress.
    Miller also said in the interview that he did not believe
the new U.S. protection of 11 Kuwaiti tanker ships in the
Persian Gulf would require a supplemental request to Congress
later for more defense money.

<title>FRANCE PLANS TO COVER SOCIAL SECURITY DEFICIT</title>
<dateline>    PARIS, April 9 - </dateline>French government ministers will meet next
Tuesday to discuss measures to cover the state Social Security
Fund's deficit before the summer, Prime Minister Jacques
Chirac's social affairs adviser, Marie-Helene Berard, said.
    Employment Ministry officials say the fund, in surplus
until 1985, faces a 24 billion franc deficit by the end of this
year, largely because of rising unemployment. Budget Minister
Alain Juppe said the fund needed more resources and a
management overhaul. The government was not in favour of
introducing an additional tax to fund the deficit as did the 
previous socialist administration between 1982 and 1985, he
said.

<title>DANSKE BANK IS FIRST DANISH BANK TO ISSUE CDS</title>
<dateline>    COPENHAGEN, March 9 - </dateline>Den Danske Bank af 1871 A/S said it
was issuing the first certificates of deposit from a Danish
bank and that the CDs will be for six, nine and 12 months or a
negotiable period.
    They will come in denominations of 10 mln crowns without
commission to the bank. Interest will be linked to money and
capital market rates and paid on a discount basis, with
certificates sold below par and maturing at par, a bank
statement said.
    The certificates are not liable to stamp duty. "They will be
a flexible supplement to negotiated deposits and will give
companies and institutional investors better chances to
organise liquidity," the statement said.
    Bank spokesman Arne Lund said "We could not do it earlier
because it was not possible for the tax authorities to say if
the certificates were liable to stamp duty or not."
    He said the issue should be assisted by high short-term
interest rates.

<title>BALLY <BLY> CONSIDERING SALE OF SIX FLAGS</title>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, March 13 - </dateline>Bally Manufacturing Corp said it is
considering the sale of its Six Flag theme amusement park unit
and would use the proceeds to pay off debt.
    In addition to the possible sale of the amusement parks,
Bally plans to sell a minority stake in its health club chain
to the public. The company will register a proposed offering
with the Securities and Exchange Commission for 20 to 30 pct of
the health clubs soon, spokesman William Peltier told Reuters.
    "Selling Six Flags is definitely under consideration,"
Peltier said in response to an inquiry. He said the company
would use much of the income from the amusement park chain,
were it to be sold, to repay debt.
    Six Flags might sell for as much as 300 mln dlrs, analysts
said. The health club chain, the nation's largest, is valued at
350 to 375 mln dlrs, they said.
    Bally reportedly already has been approached about Six
Flags by several prospective buyers.
    The company needs the cash to begin paying back a 1.6 mln
dlrs mountain of debt.
    Bally recently completed a 439 mln dlrs acquisition of the
Golden Nugget casino hotel in Atlantic City from Golden Nugget
Inc <GNG.N>.
    The purchase pushed its long-term debt to 1.6 billion dlrs,
or almost 2.7 times its equity of 600 mln dlrs.
    Bally's 325-unit health and tennis clubs had revenues in
1986 of more than 450 mln dlrs, or about 28 pct of Bally's
total revenues of 1.64 billion dlrs.
    Bally acquired Six Flags for 147.4 mln dlrs in January 1982
from Penn Central Corp. Bally bought the Great America theme
park in Gurnee, Ill., in May 1984 for 113.2 mln dlrs from
Marriott Corp <mhs>.
    In 1986 the parks had pretax operating profit of 48.6 mln
dlrs on revenues of 369.4 mln dlrs.
    The clubs and equipment unit combined to post operating
profit of 60.4 mln dlrs on revenues of 475.6 mln dlrs in 1986,
of which 456.2 mln came from the clubs.
    The company earlier this month said it will take a charge
to earnings in the first quarter of 17.3 mln dlrs as a result
of its deal to buy back 2.6 mln of its common shares from real
estate developer Donald Trump.
    Under a February 21 deal, Bally agreed to buy the 2.6 mln
of the 3.06 mln shares held by Trump at 24 dlrs a share, or
62.4 mln dlrs, plus 6.2 mln dlrs related expenses in exchange
for Trump not seeking control of the company for 10 years.
    The deal also requires Bally to buy Trump's remaining
shares for 33 dlrs a share if the stock price does not reach
that level by February 21, 1988.

<title>N.Z. FOREIGN DEBT FALLS TO 32.94 BILLION DLRS</title>
<dateline>    WELLINGTON, March 10 - </dateline>New Zealand's total foreign debt
fell to 32.94 billion N.Z. Dlrs in the quarter end December 31
against 33.42 billion in the quarter end September 30, revised
from 33.12 billion dlrs, and 24.61 billion in the quarter end
March 1985, the statistics department said.
    The department began releasing quarterly figures in June
1986.
    It said in a statement Government Corporation foreign debt
in the December quarter fell to 5.86 billion against a 6.78
billion in the September quarter, revised from 6.63 billion and
5.25 billion in March quarter 1985.
    Private sector foreign debt fell to 5.75 billion dlrs from
5.89 billion, revised from 5.74 billion, and 5.45 billion in
March 1985.
    Government departments and Reserve Bank foreign debt rose
to 21.32 billion against 20.75 billion and 13.92 billion.
    Contributing to the total fall of 0.48 billion dlrs were
2.11 billion in net realised and unrealised exchange gains, a
result of an appreciation of the New Zealand dollar against
other currencies, the department said.
    The U.S. Dollar remained the predominant borrowing currency
for all three sectors in the economy at December 31.

<title>CRUDE OIL PRICES UP AS STOCKS, OUTPUT FALL</title>
<author>    BY TED D'AFFLISIO, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </dateline>U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18 
dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price
could rise another dollar as inventories fall.
    "OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash market
there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time
to major refining centers," said Daniel McKinley, oil analyst
with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. "That could send prices
50 cts to a dollar higher," he added.
    The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to
18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week.
    The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in
February more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a
barrel.
    "Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that
oil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its
15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come
under question," McKinley said.
    Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly
report said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in
industrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during
the first quarter of this year.
    IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first
quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose
inventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln
tonnes, or about 74 days consumption.
    Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd
draw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday
fed speculation that other major companies were destocking.
    Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a
so-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying
officially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization
to offer discounts to the official price.
    "This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the
ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively
soon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March),"
the general trading manager of an international oil company
told Reuters in a telephone interview.
    For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting
excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own
output, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to
be 14.7 mln bpd this week.
    Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend
oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments.
    "This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000
bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues,
the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting
it to be there," McKinley said.
    International oil traders said that other short-haul
crudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian
refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily
available Mideast crudes earlier this week.
    If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up
the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading
managers at several companies told Reuters.
    But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long
OPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues.
    Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity
Management, said OPEC production was lower "because of the
Saudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it
gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas."
     He added, "The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other
members who produce over their quota, and the drain on the
Saudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low
as 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price," he added.
    There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the
spot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said.
    Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery
into the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which
traded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of
18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light.
    Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far
East at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price.
    "There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government
deals, which are below official prices and this is probably
being resold," one international trader said.

<text>
<title>PENNZOIL <PZL> PLOTS STRATEGY TO FIGHT TEXACO</title>
<author>    By JULIE VORMAN, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    HOUSTON, April 13 - </dateline>Pennzoil Co, frustrated by Texaco Inc's
<TX> decision to seek bankruptcy protection from its 10.3
billion dlr court judgment, is preparing to launch a new
assault that may include investigating assets Texaco
transferred from its corporate parent to subsidiaries, legal
experts said.
    Joe Jamail, a Houston lawyer for Pennzoil, said the company
would file a challenge to Texaco's bankruptcy petition sometime
this week accusing the oil giant of bad faith and ignoring its
fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders.
    The action is almost certain to ignite a new round of
debate between the two companies stemming from Texaco's 1984
acquisition of Getty Oil Co for 10.2 billion dlrs, a company
Pennzoil believed it had an agreement to buy.
    "We're going to be doing a lot of things they may not
like," Jamail said, referring to the bankruptcy court
proceeding in New York.
    Some legal experts suggested that a mud-slinging battle in
bankruptcy court between the two companies might also provoke
Congressional interest in whether the bankruptcy code is too
lenient because it permits a profitable firm to freeze debts.
    Texaco, which has assets totaling 34.9 billion dlrs, sought
protection Sunday under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy
code rather than risk having a Texas appeals court order the
company to post a security bond for the entire amount of the
Pennzoil judgment.
    Gerald Treece, dean of the South Texas College of Law and
an observer of the litigation during the past three years, said
Pennzoil was unlikely to prove Texaco is not qualified to be in
bankruptcy court simply because the giant oil company has a
positive cash flow and assets that far exceed its liabilities.
    But Pennzoil may be successful in raising the issue of
whether Texaco improperly transferred certain assets from the
corporate parent into subsidiaries unaffected by the bankruptcy
filing, Treece said.
    "Pennzoil's lawyers are going to be like dogs barking at
the heels of Texaco wherever they go," Treece said, "I think
people are going to be surprised at the level of intensity that
Pennzoil will use in searching for hidden Texaco assets."
    Jamail said Pennzoil objected to Texaco's transfer of an
oil refinery and chemical plant in Port Arthur, Texas from its
corporate parent to a subsidiary on Dec. 9, 1985, one day
before a state court judge entered the record jury award
against Texaco. Jamail suggested that the refinery and chemical
plant, valued at about 1.1 billion dlrs, were deliberately
placed out of reach of the Texas jury judgment.
    But Richard Lieb, an attorney with Kronish, Lieb, Weiner
and Hellman in New York, said Texaco could elect to place
additional subsidiaries into bankruptcy if necessary.
    In the petition filed Sunday, only Texaco Inc, the
corporate parent, and two financial subsidiaries were included
in the bankruptcy case. The businesses account for only about
four pct of Texaco's total revenues.
    Mickey Sheinfeld, a Houston lawyer who represented
Continental Airlines in an historic bankruptcy case that set
aside labor union agreements, said the track record of the
bitter Texaco-Pennzoil struggle indicates that the two
companies could spend two or three years fighting in bankruptcy
court.
    "The courts have been very interested in the issue of
good-faith bankruptcy filings. This may prove to be a landmark
case in developing that issue," Sheinfeld said.
    Texaco, he said, was following the example set by Manville
Corp, A.H. Robins Co and other firms that fell into bankruptcy
expressly to avoid paying large legal judgments. Bankruptcy
laws were relaxed in 1978 so that a company no longer needed to
prove it was insolvent in order to seek protection from
creditors.
    Texaco lawyers bristle at the suggestion that the company
entered bankruptcy to spite Pennzoil.
    Gibson Gayle, a Texaco lawyer, said the company had every
right to seek protection from creditors, and that Texaco had
embarked on an internal restructuring plan in December 1984
that required transferring various assets among subsidiaries.
But Treece said the high profile of the Texaco bankruptcy case
may also put the company under an uncomfortable spotlight.
    "What seems fair and what may be legally correct may be two
entirely different things," Treece said. "This may be a signal
to Congress to do something about tightening the bankruptcy
laws. You are either a chicken or a duck, just like you are
either bankrupt or you're not."

<title>SONY INCREASING PRODUCTION ABROAD</title>
<dateline>    BONN, March 30 - </dateline>Sony Corp <SNE.T> will increase production
abroad to overcome falling profits caused by the yen's rise
against the dollar, managing board chairman Akio Morita told
the West German newspaper Die Welt.
    He was quoted as saying that Sony, whose latest profit
figures had been affected strongly by dollar fluctuations,
would increase production in the U.S. And Europe.
    Several production facilities were being built, he added.
"At the same time we are also investing capital in order to
modernise our locations and raise our productivity."
    Morita said that to overcome the same currency problems,
Japan needs to restructure its economy in order to live less
from exports and more from domestic demand.
    He said U.S. And European companies had made the mistake of
not investing enough in the future, which was why they had lost
their lead in consumer electronics.
    "They may spend a lot of money on research and development,"
he said. "But planning and marketing are very important sectors
in developing a marketable product."
    "If they don't spend money on these, they can't build up new
business lines."
    Speaking of difficulties foreign firms experience in
penetrating the Japanese market, Morita said "Naturally, I have
to admit that there are still many obstacles in Japan."
    On the other hand, many foreign firms were too interested
in short-term success, he said.
    "If, therefore, a company comes to Japan and wants to make a
profit at once on this market, it is not so simple."
    "These people then complain, while the successful firms keep
their mouths shut," Morita said.

<title>MONOCLONAL ANTIBODIES <MABS> ORDER BARS SALES</title>
<dateline>    MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif., March 24 - </dateline>Monoclonal Antibodies Inc
said a a district court has decided to grant a motion by
Hybritech Inc, a unit of Eli Lilly and Co <LLY>, preventing the
sale of certain Monoclonal products.
    The products, including Ovustick Self-Test and Advance, a
pregnancy test, account for 80 pct of Monoclonal sales, the
biotechnology company said.
    The products are made by Monoclonal and marketed by Ortho
Pharmaceutical Corp, a unit of Johnson and Johnson <JNJ>.
    The products were named in lawsuits dating back to 1984,
the company said.
    Documents will be filed within 10 days for the judge to
issue a preliminary injunction, which should become effective
after the filing, the company said.
    The company is evaluating the impact of the injunction on
its operations. "While we're of course extremely disappointed
by the court's decision, we will continue development efforts
on products not subject to a potential infringement ruling,
particularly diagnostic tests for drugs of abuse and sexually

    The company hopes to have the new products available for
sale late this year or early next year, it said.
    In the meantime, it will focus efforts on marketing
products not affected by the injunction and designing other
products, it added.

<title>EC TO ABOLISH TAX ON SPANISH MAIZE EXPORTS</title>
<dateline>    BRUSSELS, March 19 - </dateline>The European Community Commission has
decided to abolish a special tax of eight Ecus per tonne
imposed on exports of Spanish maize, Commission sources said.
    They said the tax, which applies to Spanish sales to EC and
non-EC countries alike, would no longer be required on exports
from Spanish ports south of Valencia.
    The decision was taken at a meeting of the authority's
cereals management committee today.
    The tax had been introduced last September at the same time
as a subsidy of eight Ecus per tonne was brought in for exports
of maize to Spain from other EC member countries.
    The aim of the tax was to prevent the maize imported into
Spain from the other EC states with the help of subsidies from
being reexported back to them.
    The sources added that Spain had received no answer from
the committee to its request that tenders be opened for the
sale to third countries of 450,000 tonnes of maize.
    The request will be considered at the committee's next
meeting, the commission sources said.
    Madrid estimates that it needs to import 1.7 mln tonnes of
maize this year, while an EC-U.S. accord guarantees non-EC
producer sales to Spain of two mln tonnes of maize and 300,000
tonnes of sorghum annually for the next four years.

<dateline>    TOKYO, March 11 - </dateline>The yen's rise against the dollar is
expected to boost Japan's unemployment rate to an average 3.3
pct in the 1987/88 fiscal year beginning April 1 from January's
record three pct, the private Nomura Research Institute said.
    The official 1987/88 estimate is 2.9 pct.
    The research arm of Nomura Securities Co forecast
unemployment would exceed two mln by mid-fiscal 1987, against
an estimated 1.75 mln for the current year.
    Nomura urged the government to take pump-priming measures
to help redress trade imbalances and boost employment.
    Employment in manufacturing during fiscal 1987/88 was
predicted to fall 550,000 from the current year due to higher
job losses in the steel, shipbuilding and heavy electrical
machinery sectors, Nomura said.
    Employment in the non-manufacturing sector will continue to
increase, the institute said, without giving figures.

<title>U.S. SENATE, HOUSE BUDGET CHIEFS AGREE ON TAX</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 16 - </dateline>The chairmen of the House and Senate
Budget Committees are in general accord on the need to cut the
federal budget deficit by about 36 billion dlrs, half through
new revenues, congressional sources said.
    The sources told Reuters Senate Budget Committee Chairman
Lawton Chiles, a Florida Democrat, believes that it would be
necessary to raise "at least" 18 billion dlrs in higher
revenues--the same being proposed by House Budget Committee
Chairman William Gray, a Pennsylvania Democrat.
    The Senate committee will hold its first drafting session
on a budget tomorrow, the House group later in the week.
    Both sides want to meet a congressional target of April 15
for congressional approval of a new budget. However, the
Congressional Budget Office said that a deficit cut of 36
billion dlrs will fail to reach the Gramm-Rudman budget law
goal of a 108 billion dlr deficit and would fall 27 billion
dlrs short. 
    President Reagan's budget, not accepted by either
committee, proposed about 36 billion dlrs in deficit
reductions--including some 22 billion dlrs in new revenues
through asset sales and excise fees--off of an estimated
deficit base of 144 billion dlrs.
    Reagan said his budget hits the Gramm-Rudman goal for 1988
but the Congressional Budget Office said it is way off the mark
with over optimistic economic assumptions.
    Currently, there are discussions underway by House and
Senate committees to redefine the fixed Gramm-Rudman targets
for more realistic levels that can be reached, which would push
off by a year or two the 1991 goal for a balanced budget,
sources said.

<title>WORLD BANK SEEKS MORE AGGRESSIVE DEBT ROLE</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 29 - </dateline>The World Bank is prepared to play a
more aggressive role in promoting Third World development and
easing the debt crisis, bank president Barber Conable said.
    "We must be realistic about the immediate prospects for an
expansion in voluntary commercial bank lending, with the World
Bank playing an even more vigorous role in the debt crisis,"
Conable said in an interview with Newsweek magazine.
    Conable said the bank must step in to help relieve the debt
crisis, which has prompted a number of U.S. Commercial banks to
write off a portion of their Third World loans.
    "Our plans include initiatives on the debt front, as well as
greater emphasis on debt-equity swaps and the promotion of
private investment in Third World countries through our
affiliate, the International Finance Corporation," Conable said.
"The bank is primarily a development institution, not a
debt-management agency. But debt must be managed effectively or
it hampers development."
    Conable defended his reorganisation plan for the bank,
which he said was aimed at improving efficiency and limiting
bureaucracy. He added environmental considerations would play a
larger role in the evaluation of proposed projects.

<dateline>    CHICAGO, March 17 - </dateline>Midway Airlines Inc, which has
frequently been mentioned as an acquisition target, said it
declared a shareholder rights plan.
    Holders will get a dividend of one preferred share purchase
right on each outstanding share of common stock.
    Each right, when exercisable, will entitle the holder to
purchase one one-hundredth share of Series C Junior
Participating preferred stock for 50 dlrs.
    The rights are intended to assure that all holders receive
fair treatment in the event of a takeover. The company said
this is not in response to a known effort to acquire control.
    The rights will be exercisable 10 days after a person or
group buys 20 pct of the company's common, or announces or
commences a tender offer that would result in acquisition of 30
pct or more of its common.
    Midway can redeem the rights at two cts each at any time
prior to expieration of 10 days after the acquisition by any
person of 20 pct or more of the companyt's common, it said.
    If Midway is acquired, each right will entitle its hodler
to purchase a number of the acquiring company's common shares
having a market value at that time of twice the right's
exercise price.
    The dividend will be payable to holders of record April
six, and expire 10 years later on April 6, 1997.

<title>JAPAN STUDY URGES FOREIGN ACCESS TO FARM MARKETS</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 3 - </dateline>Japan should increase foreign access to
its farm products market, while encouraging further development
of domestic agriculture, a government report said.
    The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31
said active participation in writing world farm trade rules at
the next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
talks will help prepare Japan to improve access.
    Agriculture Ministry sources said the paper marked an
easing in Japan's tough position on agricultural imports which
stressed the need for strict controls on some products to
maintain self-sufficiency in food.
    Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs,
down from 61 pct some 20 years ago, official figures show.
    The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow to
improve productivity and demand/supply imbalances.
    The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainly
responsible for higher domestic prices, it said.
    The strong yen has meant lower input material prices but
has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has
worsened working conditions among part-time farmers, the paper
said.
    This could make it difficult to improve the industry's
structure, the paper said.
    To solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices
to more reasonable levels, Japan should try to restructure the
the agricultural sector to improve productivity and make it
self-supporting, it said.

<title>VENEZUELA TO LEND OIL TO ECUADOR FOR EXPORT</title>
<dateline>    Caracas, march 11 - </dateline>venezuela will supply ecuador with an
as yet undetermined amount of crude oil to help it meet export
commitments, seriously affected by last week's earthquake,
energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti said.
    He gave few details about the deal, but said a crude oil
loan agreement will be made between state oil companies
petroleos de venezuela (pdvsa) and ecuador's cepe.
    Ecuador was forced to suspend oil exports for an expected
four months after an earthquake damaged a pipeline. Oil
accounts for 60 per cent of its export income.
     Hernandez was speaking to reporters at miraflores palace
on the results of talks with ecuador's deputy energy minister
fernando santos alvite, who arrived here last night.
    "the volume lent to ecuador would be discounted from its
opec quota and would not affect venezuela's," he said. "we would
from august on produce our own quota and sell the additional
amounts that ecuador would be repaying us," he said.
    He did not elaborate on the quota arrangements but did say
ecuador would notify opec by telex that venezuela would be
lending it a certain amount over so many days.
    Venezuela's opec output quota is currently 1.495 million
barrels a day, and ecuador's has been set at 210,000 bpd.

<dateline>    QUITO, March 14 - </dateline>Ecuador announced an austerity program
and a price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of last
week's earthquake which killed at least 300 people.
    Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said in a televised
address that the budget would be cut by five to 10 pct,
government hiring would be frozen and salaries of top
officials, including the president and cabinet, would be
reduced.
    He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic
consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of petrol
would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares would rise by
20 pct. Petrol supplies would also be limited.
    Information Ministry officials said the price freeze was
aimed at protecting poor Ecuadoreans from a wave of
specualtion. Violators would be severely punished, according to
the price freeze order, signed by five cabinet ministers.
    The items for which prices were frozen included rice,
sugar, cooking oil, potatoes, salt, wheat flour, cigarettes,
soft drinks, school supplies and several kinds of vegetables.
    Ecuador's consumer price inflation was 23 pct in 1986.
    The price of 92-octane petrol rises to 110 sucres a U.S.
Gallon from 65 sucres. Eighty-octane petrol increases to 90
sucres from 50.

<title>U.S. CORN MARKET SKEWED BY SOVIET BUYING</title>
<author>    By Andrew Stern, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, March 18 - </dateline>Recent purchases of U.S. corn by the
Soviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing
the price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulf
export point and interior levels, cash grain dealers said.
    Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce the
cash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior -- which a
dealer in Davenport, Iowa, said was roughly 20 pct wider than
normal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel -- by making
it worthwhile for farmers to move grain.
    By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn, the USDA
could encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales,
where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the
government price support loan program and then marketed.
    If the USDA acts soon, as many dealers expect, the movement
would break the Gulf corn basis.
    "The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine county
posted prices," one dealer said. "It should be taking the
average of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City," which
would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior
Midwest.
    "But we don't know when they might do it," an Ohio dealer
said, which has created uncertainty in the market.
    The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effort
to free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to
the government and remain off the market and in storage.
    Yesterday, USDA issued a report showing that only slightly
more than 50 pct of the 3.85 billion dlrs in PIK certificates
it has issued to farmers (in lieu of cash payments) had to date
been exchanged for grain.
    With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIK
certificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months, the
USDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain
by adjusting the ASCS prices, cash grain dealers said.
    A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise in
barge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwest
to the export terminals, cash dealers said.
    Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risen
nearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the
original tariff price. The mild winter and early reopening of
the mid-Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged the
firmer trend in barge freight, dealers noted.
    The higher transportation costs have served to depress
interior corn basis levels, squeezing the margins obtained by
the elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well as
discouraging farmer marketings, they said.
    "The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports,"
which indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as much
as 4.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn, one Midwest cash grain trader
said.
    But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside,
freight rates will settle back down because of the overall
surplus of barges on the Midwest river system.

<title>PREMIER SAYS YUGOSLAVIA WILL PAY ITS DEBTS</title>
<author>    By Peter Humphrey, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    BELGRADE, March 23 - </dateline>Yugoslavia, whose economic crisis is
under close scrutiny by foreign creditors, will not follow
Brazil by suspending repayments on its large foreign debt,
Prime Minister Branko Mikulic was quoted as saying.
    Mikulic was speaking to West German journalists in an
interview published yesterday by the Tanjug news agency.
    He said Yugoslavia had always paid its debts and would
continue to do so, but he said creditors and international
institutions should show more "understanding" for Yugoslavia's
situation.
    Mikulic said Yugoslavia had "understanding" for what Brazil
had done.
    Yugoslavia has almost 100 pct annual inflation, lagging
exports and low productivity. This month Makulic imposed
partial freezes on wages and prices which led to widespread
strikes. Tanjug said in the interview Mikulic warned the army
could be called in if Yugoslavia's political system was
threatened. Official reports show Yugoslavia ended 1986 with
hard currency debt of 19.7 billion dlrs. In 1986 it repaid a
record 5.97 billion in capital and interest, reducing its
overall debt by 996 mln dlrs.
    Government ministers told reporters last week they
regretted Yugoslavia made such an effort in 1986. They said the
cost to the economy had been too great.
    Earlier this month deputy prime minister Janos
Milosavljevic said Yugoslavia needed new credits. Foreign
Minister Raif Dizdarevic said in Caracas, "radical changes" in
interest rates and repayment times were needed.
    Western economists said Mikulic's remarks, taken with those
of his ministers, could be a signal some problems were seen
ahead in financing the debt repayments.
    Yugoslavia's debt refinancing timetable is to be considered
by the Paris club at the end of this month.
    The International Monetary Fund, which recently reviewed
the Yugoslav economy, is said by Western diplomats to be
alarmed at what it sees as a deteriorating economic crisis here
and the possibility of balance of payments problems later this
year.
    Mikulic visits West Germany next week, and debt is expected
to figure high on the agenda of his talks with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl.

<title>CREDIT CARD DISCLOSURE BILLS INTRODUCED</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Feb 26 - </dateline>Legislation to require disclosure of
credit card fees and interest rates before the cards are issued
have been introduced in the Senate and House.
    Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Conn, a co-sponsor of the bill, said
many banks and financial institutions do not disclose all the
information about terms of their cards in promotional material
sent to prospective customers.
    "By requiring card issuers to disclose the terms and
conditions of their cards at the time of solicitation, the
legislation is intended to arm consumers with enough
information to shop around for the best deal," Dodd said in a
statement.

<title>LAWSON SAYS G-7 TO REVIEW PARIS ACCORD NEXT WEEK</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, April 2 - </dateline>The Group of Seven industrialised
countries will make use of next week's International Monetary
Fund meetings in Washington to evaluate the Paris accord on
currency stabilisation, U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson told reporters.
    "On Tuesday I shall be going to Washington for meetings of
the (IMF) Interim Committee and Development Committee, and we
shall of course be having a meeting of the G-7," Lawson said.
    "And on the G-7, although there is no formal agenda, I would
imagine that the first thing we do would be to review how the
Paris accord has gone since it was agreed in February."
    Lawson said G-7 finance ministers will be reviewing
medium-term economic objectives and projections involving
domestic and external variables. Also examined will be
performance indicators for each country.
    The Paris accord set objectives for such sectors as growth,
inflation, current account and trade balances, budget
performances, monetary conditions and exchange rates.
    Lawson said "At both the G-7 and the Interim Committee we
will undoubtedly be discussing the debt problem. Clearly the
debt problem is still with us, and still with us in quite a big
way."

Baker, as President Reagan's communications director.
    Officials said an announcement was expected to be made
during Reagan's trip to Philadelphia where the president is to
make a speech to a group of doctors on the deadly disease AIDS
(Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome).
    Griscom, 37, was brought into the White House by former
Senator Baker to help with the transition after Baker was named
chief of staff following the resignation of Donald Regan in the
wake of the Iran arms scandal.
    He will take the job vacated by Patrick Buchanan, a
high-profile conservative, who served two years as
communications director.

<title>U.S. URGES BANKS TO DEVELOP NEW 3RD WLD FINANCE</title>
<author>    By Peter Torday</author>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 13 - </dateline>The United States this week signaled
it is pressing commercial banks, increasingly disenchanted with
providing large cash loans to debtor nations, to develop new
ways of financing that will prove more acceptable to both
sides.
    Heading off challenges to its Third World debt strategy,
U.S. officials also say they think concessions should be made
to debtors that enact reforms speeding inflation-free growth.
    In particular, they stress new techniques that shift the
emphasis from debt to equity and shave interest rates.
    "The strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative or
concept that there can be additional emphasis such as in
debt-equity swaps and that sort of thing," a Reagan
administration official said of the slow pace of commercial
bank lending to the Third World.
    "The debtors have been performing well...some people argue
that taking 1-1/8 pct down to 13/16 pct is debt forgiveness.
Well if that's what it is, fine. What it really is a narrowing
of the spread that could be charged on new money," the official
said.
    This week, therefore, U.S. officials signaled their backing
for a novel proposal by the Philippines that called for partial
payment of interest in tradeable investment notes.
    On Tuesday, officials said Treasury Secretary James Baker
told Secretary of State George Shultz the idea was a creative
one and signaled his approval to Philippine Finance Minister
Jamie Ongpin later that day. An administration official told
Reuters this week the Philippines' proposal to partially pay
interest with investment notes instead of cash should be
considered seriously by the banks. An agreement with the banks,
officials now say, is expected soon.
    "New bank lending has been slow in materializing but the
fact of the matter is there have been 70 billion dlrs in bank
loans restructured, which is a form of extension of credit. As
you know, there's been 8.5 billion dlrs in new money," said the
official, who plays a key role in keeping the plan afloat.
    The plan was launched in October 1985 by Secretary Baker
and called on commercial and multilateral banks to lend 29
billion dlrs in the subsequent three years to major debtors
undertaking reforms that promoting economic growth.
    But it has taken almost six months to complete the
syndication of a 7.5 billion dlrs loan to Mexico, which has
created deep misgivings here about the liklihood of such large
straight cash loans being assembled ever again.
    U.S. officials want the banks not only to consider swapping
their debts for equity in local corporations -- a development
that has already met with success in Chile and Mexico -- but to
pin loans on specific projects, finance trade and invest
directly in debtor country private sectors.
    These forms of lending, they say, give the banks a greater
stake and more economically secure return on investment.
    In a major challenge to the U.S. plan, Brazil last month
declared a moratorium on interest payments and followed it up
with a world tour by officials seeking a political way out of
its 109 billion dlr debt burden.
    The country is beset by a falling trade surplus and
dwindling reserves endangering its ability to service its
foreeign debt, at 109 billion dlrs the Third World's largest.
    One official attending the Washington talks with Brazilian
Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said "they've come in here now
and said "Look, we're out of money, help us," but they haven't
come in with a plan. And they've gone all over the world, and
at every stop they've been told the same thing."
    The official said Brazil would have to enact a credible
economic program, either in consultation with the World Bank or
the International Monetary Fund, to cool its overheated economy
before commercial banks would begin negotiations.
    As a result of the Brazilian action, private banks and
major debtor nations redoubled their efforts to reach
agreements stretching out debt repayments.
    For its part, the administration has signaled its strong
support for new techniques that in some cases effectively
amount to interest rate concessions for major debtor nations.
    It pressed the banks to allow Chile to make annual instead
of bi-annual interest payments, speeding an accord.
    Administration officials, who asked not to be named, have
also debated whether to allow banks greater flexibility in
building up loan loss reserves against Third World loans.
    The debate centers on a rule, known as FASB-15, under which
banks experiencing delayed interest payments on real estate
loans need not set aside reserves against debt principal if it
is believed payments will resume.
    More recently, the rule was extended to cover farm and
energy loans and Senator Bill Bradley, a New Jersey Democrat,
has suggested it should be extended to Third World loans.
    Bradley is prominent among Congressmen urging that
provisions for debt relief be attached to tough new trade
legislation now being considered on Capitol Hill.
    But the officials said the debate has been inconclusive.

<title>VIOLENCE REPORTED IN ECUADOR GENERAL STRIKE</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, March 26 - </dateline>At least 14 people were injured and many
arrested in clashes during a one-day general strike called by
Ecuadorean workers to protest against austerity measures
imposed after a major earthquake on March 5.
    Interior Minister Luis Robles said the worst violence was
in Quito, where demonstrators threw rocks at a luxury hotel and
a number of banks.
    Over 80 people in eight cities were detained for stoning
police, attacking troops, damaging buildings and setting fire
to cars, he said. The casualty and damage toll is expected to
rise as detailed reports reach the capital from the provinces.
    Labour leaders said they shut down all of Ecuador's
industrial plants, but Labour Minister Jorge Egas said of the
country's 900 largest factories only 86 were closed, 32 were
partially working and the rest operating normally.
    The strike, called by leftist unions and declared illegal
by the government, was aimed at pressing the administration to
scrap an austerity program adopted on March 13 following an
earthquake that killed up to 1,000 people and caused an
estimated billion dlrs in damage.

<title>OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS</title>
<author>    BY TED D'AFFLISIO, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, Feb 26 - </dateline>OPEC may be forced to meet before a
scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting
agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide
in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.
    "The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy
as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out
the problems," said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, CERA.
    Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC
faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.
    "OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production
issue and must be addressed in that way," said Paul Mlotok, oil
analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.
    He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its
ability to keep production under control have given way to a
pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if
it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.
    But some other analysts were uncertain that even an
emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production
above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.
    "OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have
deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials," said the
regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke
on condition that he not be named. "The market is now trying to
teach them that lesson again," he added.
    David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC
to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is
not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.
    "They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the
winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April
when demand slackens," Mizrahi said.
    But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more
than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd."
    Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for
OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.
    "OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks
since buyers will come back into the market then," said Dillard
Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.
    But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy
and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil
has been rising through the first quarter and this may have
prompted excesses in its production.
    "Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd
and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we
are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this
demand through current production," he told Reuters in a
telephone interview.

<dateline>    PARIS, April 29 - </dateline>The U.S. Economy has peaked and will slow
to a growth rate of between 2.5 pct and three pct for the
remainder of 1987, First Boston Corp Managing Director Albert
Wojnilower said.
    He told an investment conference the U.S. Economy will not
be able to sustain the 4.3 pct growth rate recorded in first
quarter gross national product.
    He said continued intermittent attacks on the U.S. Currency
could lead to a substantial rise in long term interest rates.
However, he predicted that rates will eventually decline either
in anticipation of a recession or because of one.

intends to maintain the agreement, Enzo said. Ortho also plans
to keep a 1982 research contract in effect, it said.
    Enzo said it continues to work under the contract and
recognize revenues on a cost recovery basis. It recognized
revenues under the 1985 contract of 820,000 dlrs and 1,655,000
dlrs for the quarter and six months, respectively.
    The revenues recognized were only partially received, an
Enzo spokesman said. He declined to elaborate.
    Total revenues were 2,944,000 dlrs for the quarter and
6,200,000 dlrs in the six months ended Jan 31, 1987.
    The next payment under the 1985 contract of 1.5 mln dlrs is
due in June, the spokesman said.

    The rise mostly reflected a technical consolidation of

tapering off and origin offers were insignificant, providing

<title>CHINA CLOSES SECOND ROUND OF OFFSHORE OIL BIDS</title>
<dateline>    PEKING, March 12 - </dateline>China has closed the second round of
bidding by foreign firms for offshore oil exploration rights,
the China Daily has reported.
    It quoted a spokesman for the China National Offshore Oil
Corp (CNOOC) as saying China signed eight contracts with 15
foreign firms for blocks in the Pearl River mouth and south
Yellow Sea covering a total area of 44,913 sq km.
    Second round bidding began at the end of 1984 and only one
well has so far produced results -- Lufeng 13-1-1, 250 km
south-east of Shenzhen, with an output of 6,770 barrels a day.
The well was drilled by a group of Japanese companies.
    The spokesman added CNOOC was ready to enter into contracts
for offshore blocks before third round bidding began. He did
not say when this would be, but added the contracts would not
be bound by restrictions imposed during the second round.
    China has signed 36 oil contracts and agreements with 37
companies from 10 countries since 1979, when offshore
exploration was open to foreigners. Eleven contracts were
terminated after no oil was discovered.
    Foreign firms have invested 2.1 billion dlrs on offshore
China since 1979.

<dateline>    STOCKHOLM, April 7 - </dateline>Swedish industry expects a rise in
both production and exports during this year, with engineering
and forest companies forecasting the largest increases, a
survey by the National Institute for Economic Research showed.
    The government institute said in the survey -- of 2,000
manufacturing companies -- that industry this year planned to
reduce both raw material and finished goods inventories.
    It said domestic demand was expected to be mainly unchanged
but that exports should rise significantly. The number of firms
operating at full capacity fell slightly, however, in the first
quarter, said the report, which gave no figures.

<title>USX <X> PROVED OIL, GAS RESERVES FALL IN 1986</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 11 - </dateline>USX Corp said proved reserves of oil
and natural gas liquids fell 28 pct to 802.8 mln barrels at the
end of 1986 from 1.12 billion barrels at year-end 1985.
    The figures, in USX's just-released 1986 annual report,
indicate much of the drop resulted from the exclusion of 293.7
mln barrels of Libyan reserves, after the U.S. government last
June directed U.S. oil companies to end Libyan operations.
    USX, which owns Marathon Oil Co and Texas Oil and Gas Corp,
had 60 pct of its 1986 sales of 14.94 billion dlrs from its oil
and gas operations.
    About 24 pct of total sales came from USX's USS steel unit
and 16 pct from diversified businesses, which include oilfield
services, raw materials, minerals, chemicals and real estate.
    According to the report, domestic liquids reserves fell
slightly to 628.5 mln barrels from 628.9 mln and foreign
reserves fell to 174.3 mln from 486.4 mln barrels. The large
drop in foreign reserves was in the Middle East and Africa,
where they fell to about 9.3 mln barrels from 316.7 mln,
reflecting the exclusion of Libya.
    Total natural gas reserves fell to 4.82 trillion cubic feet
at year-end 1986 from 5.18 trillion at the end of 1985.
    Again, most of the drop came from the Middle East and
Africa, where reserves fell to zero from 71.9 billion cubic
feet, excluding Libyan reserves.
    U.S. natural gas reserves fell to 3.44 trillion cubic feet
from 3.65 trillion and foreign reserves fell to 1.38 trillion
from 1.53 trillion.
    In other areas, USX said total capital spending fell to 962
mln dlrs in 1986 from 1.78 billion dlrs in 1985. The 1986
audited figure is eight mln dlrs higher than the unaudited
figure the company reported on Jan 27.
    USX also said it expects to record a gain of 150 mln dlrs
in 1988, representing 50 pct of previously existing investment
tax credits allowable under the new tax law. The loss of the
other half of the credits was reflected in the fourth quarter.
    In a discussion of steel results, USX said plants that were
shut down last month and some previously idled plants may be
permanently closed. USX took a fourth quarter charge of 1.03
billion dlrs to restructure its steel operations. The charge
included the "indefinite idling" last month of four plants in
Utah, Pennsylvania and Texas.
    Other plants or parts of plants in Pennsylvania, Indiana,
Alabama, Ohio and Chicago had been previously idled.
    "These operations are not permanently shut down. Improved
market conditions for the products from these plants may make
it feasible to reopen some of them," USX said in the report.
    "On the other hand, a lack of any future market improvement
may necessitate their permanent closing," it added.

<title>NL INDUSTRIES <NL> STUDIES SPIN OFF</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 31 - </dateline>NL Industries Inc said it would seek
an alternative to current plans to spin off its chemical
operations if an affiliate tries to block the plan.
    The company said the lessor of an NL Chemicals pigment
making plant in Leverkusen, West Germany, has indicated the
plan, without the lessors consent, would allow the lessor
 to buy the plant and terminate a
supplies and services agreement.
    NL said it disagrees with the lessor's position and will
seek its consent to the spin-off. If the lessor does not
consent, NL will pursue an alternative that will result in the
separation of its chemicals and petroleum services businesses.
    NL said it believes the alternative form of the separation
would not require the lessor's consent, which would not be
sought. The alternative would require approval by NL
shareholders and other parties, which should be attainable, it
said.
    As previously announced, NL plans to distribute shares of
NL Chemicals Inc common stock as a spin-off, through redemption
of NL's Series C preferred stock depositary receipts, when the
redemption is not likely to result in significant tax liability
to either NL or NL Chemicals.
    NL also said it may consider paying the redemption value of
the Series C preferred stock in cash instead of implementing
the spin-off or the alternative for separating the two
businesses.
    Under terms of the Series C preferred, NL at any time may
redeem the stock for cash. At Feb 28, 1987, the redemption
value was about 15 dlrs per depositary receipt, it said.

<title>ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR FOUR MONTHS, OFFICIAL</title>
<author>    By WALKER SIMON, REUTERS</author>
<dateline>    QUITO, March 9 - </dateline>The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil
shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at
least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.
    The official said Ecuador could resume exports after
repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links
jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.
It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,
the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35
days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.
    The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the
12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the
pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil
accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as
60 pct of government revenues.
    Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping
about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd
above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy
Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of
173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.
    However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,
costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian
pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take
about 60 days to build.
    Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,
had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end
of January, about equal to one month's imports.
    It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion
dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's
total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in
Latin America.
    In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would
loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three
months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.
    Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies
and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in
repayment in May, Lusinchi said.
    A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister
Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior
and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and
co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 24 - </dateline>Moody's Investors Service Inc said it
assigned a top-flight Aaa rating to African Development Bank's
15 billion yen senior Samurai bond due 2002 issued in Tokyo.
    The rating reflects the support provided by the callable
capital of non-borrowing member countries, which include the
U.S., Japan, Canada, West Germany and several other European
nations.
    Moody's said that African Development Bank's sound lending,
borrowing and liquidity policies also support the top rating
grade.

<title>LOWER U.S. FARM PAYMENT BASE EYED FOR SAVINGS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </dateline>Reducing the amount of crop base a
farmer can receive deficiency payments on is being looked at as
one way to cut the U.S. agriculture budget for fiscal year
1988, congressional aides and lobbyists said.
    Rep. Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) has suggested that the
planted crop base a producer receives deficiency payments on be
reduced by five pct, an aide to Stenholm said.
    The aide said no official proposal has yet been drawn up,
but that as it becomes more clear exactly how much agriculture
spending will have to reduced, specific numbers will be
discussed and a proposal could "very likely" be drafted.
    Under the proposal, if a farmer idled 20 pct of his acreage
base and was eligible to plant the remaining 80 pct, he would
receive payments on only 75 pct of his total base.
    Current regulations provide farmers with deficiency
payments on 100 pct of their non-idled acreage.
    Reducing the payment base by five pct could save around 400
to 500 mln dlrs, but would have to be applied to the 1987 crop
programs in order for any savings to accrue in fiscal year
1988, an Agriculture Department economist said.
    Stenholm's aide said when the proposal is officially
offered, it would likely be an amendment to the budget
reconciliation bill.
    Other options currently being talked about as a way to cut
one to two billion dlrs from the farm budget include increasing
acreage reduction programs, limiting farm payments,
implementing a 0/92 acreage set-aside program or limiting the
use of generic in-kind certificates.

<dateline>    AMSTERDAM, March 6 - </dateline>The Dutch central bank announced new
eleven-day special advances at an unchanged 5.3 pct to aid
money market liquidity, covering the period March 9 to 20.
    The amount will be set at tender on Monday March 9 between
0800 and 0830 GMT. The new facility will replace the current
4.8 billion guilders of seven-day advances expiring Monday.
    Money dealers estimated today's money market shortage at 11
to 11.25 billion guilders, barely changed from yesterday.
    They said call money was still relatively high at 6-1/8 to
6-1/4 pct as a result of the tight set of bids accepted by the
Bank for the previous seven-day facility.

<title>BROKERS SAY NYSE RULE SHIFT LIMITS FLEXIBILITY</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 9 - </dateline>Officials of major brokerage firms
expressed dismay at a New York Stock Exchange decision to force
strict compliance with a rule barring members from trading in
NYSE-listed issues in London during New York trading hours.
    Most major brokerage houses said they had seen no formal
notice from the NYSE on the interpretation of rule 390.
Officials of the NYSE were unavailable to explain the timing or
the technical details of enforcement of rule 390.
    "It's a step backward," said Samuel Hunter, senior vice
president for equity trading at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,
    Hunter said any perceived problems caused by overlapping
trading ought to be addressed by a search for equitable
solutions instead of "hiding behind legalistic and technical
definitions."
    The NYSE evidently feels some traders use London to
circumvent rules preventing short sales on minus ticks, Hunter
said. But he believes simultaneous printing of trades in London
and New York would be a way to have dual trading with an
element of fairness. "I'm a great advocate of the view that the
greater the volume, the better the market will be," he said.

<title>SWEDISH DRUG FIRM ASTRA RISE ON AIDS HOPES</title>
<dateline>    STOCKHOLM, April 9 - </dateline>Swedish drug firm AB Astra <ASTS.ST>
shares rose 48 crowns to 690 in the first two hours of trading
on the Stockholm Bourse, amid hopes its research into
anti-viral drugs may have promising results in the treatment of
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
    Stockbrokers said the shares, which climbed amid heavy
institutional buying, also rose in reaction to an optimistic
assessment of future products in the firm's annual report which
was released this week.
    Brokers Enskilda Fondkommission said in a report this month
that Astra was a world leader in anti-viral drugs.
    Although Enskilda said Astra had not made any breakthrough
in developing a specific drug to treat the Acquired Immune
Deficiency Syndrome it noted that investors were only now
discovering that the firm's approach in the area was promising.
    "It is clear that Astra has a tradition in anti-viral
research which should prove valuable in fighting this disease,"
the report by Enskilda, the investment banking unit of
Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken <SEBS.ST>, said.
    Company officials could not be reached for comment on the
causes of today's share rise.

<title>U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - SPENDING, M-1</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 19 - </dateline>Brisk increases in personal income and
consumption are to appear in February data released today, but
the bond market's recent sluggishness suggests there will be no
major price reaction unless the rises are much larger than
expected, economists said.
    Personal income is forecast to rise by 0.6 to 0.8 pct,
compared with no change in January, while consumption
expenditures are projected to increase 1.4 to 1.6 pct,
reversing most of the two pct drop recorded in January.
    M-1 money supply data for the March 9 week will also be
released. An increase of some 2.3 billion dlrs is expected.    
    Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co Inc
expects a one pct rise in income, led by a strong gain in wage
and salary disbursements in February.
    Nonfarm payrolls expanded by 337,000 jobs in February, the
average workweek lengthened by 0.6 pct and hourly wages rose by
four cts, he noted in a report. Vigorous spending on durable
goods last month, especially cars, foreshadow a rise of at
least 1.5 pct in consumption, he added.
    The prospect of bearish data did not trouble the bond
market much yesterday, with the 30-year Treasury bond slipping
just 7/32 to 99-28/32 for a yield of 7.51 pct.
    Analysts said the market is still trapped in a narrow
range, desperately seeking direction.
    "Seasonally adjusted, it's already December in the bond
market," quipped Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co
International Inc.
    Paul Boltz of T. Rowe Price Associates Inc said the
steadiness of long bond yields around 7.5 pct, despite some
signs of a stronger economy, probably reflects expectations
that inflation will remain subdued.
    But he warned that this assumption might not be justified.
    "It took the bond market a long while to see that inflation
was not returning to double digits, and now that it has learned
that lesson, it may be a little slow to see that a four to five
pct inflation is a real possibility ahead," Boltz said in a
report.
    After trading late yesterday at 5-15/16 pct, Fed funds were
indicated by brokers to open comfortably at 5-15/16, six pct.

<title>VENEZUELA BACKS INCREASE IN ECUADOR OPEC QUOTA</title>
<dateline>    CARACAS, Oct 19 - </dateline>Venezuela will back Ecuador's bid to
raise its OPEC quota above 221,000 barrels per day (bpd)
because it is a justifiable demand, Venezuelan Energy Minister
Arturo Hernandez Grisanti said on Monday.
    He told reporters the country deserved a higher quota in
compensation for the five months it was forced to suspend oil
production when its main pipeline was destroyed by an
earthquake last March.
    "For this five-month period, Ecuador did not exercise its
right to produce 221,000 bpd," he said. "We should recognize
Ecuador's right to increase its quota ... There is a basis of
justice in that country's petition."
    He added however, the quota increase should be gradual to
avoid harming the market, he added.
    Hernandez Grisanti said he understood Ecuador would
formally submit the request for a higher quota at the next
ministerial conference of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) opening December 9 in Vienna.

    February bankruptcies fell 14.9 pct from a year earlier,
the 26th straight monthly decline, and debts fell 54.3 pct.
    The lower number of bankruptcies in February reflected a
relaxation of money market conditions and reduced bill
settlements due to fewer operating days, it said.
    Bankruptcies caused by the strength of the yen against the
dollar totalled 69, or 6.4 pct of those in February, with debts
of 25.52 billion yen, the research firm said.
    This compared with 64 with debts of 125.59 billion yen in
January, it said.
    Currency-linked bankruptcies since November 1985, when the
dollar's depreciation against the yen began to affect Japanese
export-linked firms, totalled 772, with cumulative debts of
660.53 billion yen, it said.
    The value of the yen against the dollar rose to an average
153.49 yen per dollar in February from 184.62 a year earlier.
    Bankruptcies usually decline in the first quarter of the
year due to fewer operating days and for seasonal reasons.
    Bankruptcies are expected to increase in the quarter
starting April 1 due to expectations of slow consumer spending,
low wage increases for the 1987/88 fiscal year which starts in
April, and slow capital spending by manufacturers, the company
said.
    Bankrupcties among export-linked subcontractors will rise
due to a recent shift by major manufacturers to overseas
production, it added.

<dateline>    PEKING, March 2 - </dateline>China has signed a 130 mln dlr loan
agreement with the World Bank to partly finance 12 new berths
with an annual capacity of 6.28 mln tonnes at the 20 mln tonne
a year capacity Tianjin port, the New China News Agency said.
    China will provide 370 mln yuan for the project and a
Chinese company won a bid against 12 other firms from seven
countries to do the foundation work, it said.
    It said 11 of the new berths will be able to handle ships
of more than 10,000 tonnes, three will handle containers and
the expansion will enable the port to handle coke, non-metal
mineral ores and mining equipment for the first time.

<title>ECUADOR BEGINS WORK ON OIL PIPELINE TO COLOMBIA</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, March 13 - </dateline>Construction workers today began building
a 26 km (16 mile) pipeline to link Ecuador's jungle oilfields
to a pipeline in Colombia through which Ecuadorean crude could
be pumped to the Pacific Coast, Ecuadorean energy minsitry
officials said.
    They said it would take about two months and at least 15
mln dlrs to build the pipeline from Lago Agrio in Ecuador to
Puerto Colon, Colombia for connection to the Colombian
pipeline, which goes to the port of Tumaco on Colombia's
Pacific Ocean coast.
    The Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon pipeline is designed to
transport between 30,000 to 50,000 barrels of day (bpd) of
Ecuadorean crude to the Colombian pipeline, they said.
    The Colombian pipeline to Tumaco has ample room for
Ecuadorean crude, they said. It is currently transporting about
17,000 bpd out of its 100,000 bpd capacity, an Ecuadorean
energy ministry official said.
    The Ecuadorean crude reaching Tumaco will be shipped by
boat to Ecuador for refining into oil products to meet domestic
demand.
    The completion of the pipeline would allow Ecuador to
resume some of production, paralysed since March six by an 
earthquake the night before.
    The tremor ruptured the country's main pipeline from jungle
oilfields to the Ecuadorean port of Balao, on the Pacific
Ocean.
    Ecuador was pumping about 260,000 bpd before the
earthquake. It would take about five months to repair the
pipeline to Balao, government officials said.
    Ecuador estimates that it will cost between 145 to 150 mln
dlrs to repair oil installations damaged by the earthquake,
energy ministry Javier Espinosa said.

<dateline>    INDIANAPOLIS, April 2 - </dateline>Eli Lilly and Co said its board
decided to sell Elizabeth Arden Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary
that manufactures and markets cosmetics and fine fragrance
products.
    It said the business, which had sales of 67 mln dlrs when
it was acquired in 1971, had sales last year of 398 mln dlrs,
up 12 pct from 1985. It had operating profits of about 33 mln
dlrs in 1986.
    Lilly said it retained Morgan Stanley and Co to help
evaluate offers.
    Lilly said it expects to use the after-tax proceeds from
the sale of its cosmetics business for general corporate
purposes, including the repurchase from time to time of its
common stock or warrants on the open market.
    In a statement, Lilly Chairman Richard Wood said "This
strategic decision was reached on the basis of our belief that
in the future the corporation's resources, including its
research activities, should be focused on its other business
which have a high technology, life sciences orientation."

<title>VERSATILE TO BUILD POLAR ICE BREAKER</title>
<dateline>    OTTAWA, March 2 - </dateline>Versatile Corp's shipbuilding subsidiary
has a letter of intent to build a 320 mln dlr polar icebreaker
for the Canadian coast guard, Transport Minister John Crosbie
said.
    In a Vancouver address, Crosbie said Versatile Pacific
Shipyards Inc was the low bidder to build the Arctic Class 8
icebreaker, but the company must meet certain financial and
engineering conditions before the contract is awarded.
    The government also announced it will provide up to 13 mln
dlrs in loan insurance to help Versatile prepare for the
construction of the vessel.
said before the contract can be awarded Versatile "will be
required to offer assurances that the shipyard is technically
and financially capable of performing the work."
    Crosibie said Versatile's bid was 100 mln dlrs lower than
competing bidders and will generate 1,000 person years of
direct employment.
    Work on the vessel, which Crosbie said would be the most
powerful icebreaker in the world, would begin next year and
completed in 1992.
    The government announced plans to build the icebreaker last
year following the controversial passage of the U.S. Coast
Guard's vessel, the Polar Sea, through the disputed Northwest
Passage. The U.S. government did not seek permission for the
journey, claiming the area was an international water way.
    The government said the icebreaker was needed to back up
the country's claim of sovereignty in the Arctic.

<title>IEA SAYS OPEC FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT 16.1 MLN BPD</title>
<dateline>    PARIS, March 6 - </dateline>OPEC produced an average 16.1 mln barrels
per day (bpd) of crude oil in February, down from 16.5 mln the
previous month and an overall 17.3 mln bpd in fourth quarter
1986, the International Energy Agency said.
    A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production
quotas set at their last conference in December, but liftings
were reduced from several countries, it said in its latest
monthly oil market report.
    These cutbacks were due in part to buyer resistance to
fixed prices, introduced from February 1, particularly for
fixed volumes over an extended period.
    It gave this breakdown for OPEC crude output, in mln bpd

    TOTAL           17.3             16.5          16.1
    The IEA said while Saudi production stayed below its quota
of 4.133 mln bpd, actual sales might exceed output due to
Norbec stock disposals. Contracts for Saudi crude have been
signed, but it is understood they have much leeway in required
liftings.
    The report said the reduction in Iraqi air attacks on
Iranian export facilities allowed Iran's output to reach 2.2
mln bpd in January, but buyer resistance to fixed prices
apparently cut February production.
    It said Iraqi exports are about 1.0 mln bpd through the
Turkish pipeline, 0.1-0.2 mln by truck through Jordan and
0.2-0.3 mln via the Saudi pipeline to Yanbu. Internal
consumption is some 0.3 mln bpd.
    The IEA estimated total non-communist world oil supply in
February at 45.0 mln bpd, down from 45.4 mln in January and
47.0 mln in the fourth quarter.
    The February world supply figure is made up of 16.1 mln bpd
OPEC crude production, 1.4 mln bpd OPEC natural gas liquids
(ngls), 16.6 mln bpd OECD crude and ngls, 8.3 mln bpd other
developing countries' crude and ngls, net trade of 1.1 mln bpd
with centrally planned economies, 0.5 mln bpd of
non-conventional crudes (such as tar sands and oil from coal)
and 1.0 mln bpd from processiing gains.
    Within the OECD, preliminary Norwegian data show record
1.06 mln bpd output in January, with lower production expected
in February in accordance with government curtailments of
approximately 80,000 bpd, announced in support of OPEC.

<dateline>    TORONTO, March 23 - </dateline>Boeing Co (BA)'s wholly owned De
Havilland Aircraft Co of Canada Ltd and <Short Brothers PLC>,
of Northern Ireland said they might decide later this year
whether to launch a joint commuter/regional aircraft program.
    It said a program launch would lead to service entry for
the new aircraft in 1991.
    "Provided the ongoing market and detailing design
configuration studies confirm demand and project viability, a
decision to launch a joint program could be taken later this
year," said the companies, which agreed last autumn to a
12-month assessment of a new generation transport aircraft.
    De Havilland and Short Brothers said they agreed to the
basic parameters of the new aircraft, which they said would be
aimed at the low end of the passenger range.
    They declined to speculate on engine selection for the
plane, but said several competitive powerplants were available.

<title>N.Y. PLATINUM FUTURES FINISH HIGHER</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </dateline>Platinum futures finished higher as 
the metal continued to follow the strong silver market,
analysts said.
    The key July platinum delivery settled at 572.20 dlrs an
ounce, up 3.60 dlrs but below a session high of 577.50 dlrs.
Other months gained 3.70 to 4.60 dlrs.
    However, steady trade selling and skittish speculators kept
platinum well below session highs. "Most metals players are in
the silver pit, not here," said one floor analyst.
    Meanwhile, palladium ended 25 to 50 cts firmer, but also
under the day's highs, in sympathy.

<dateline>    SYDNEY, April 8 - </dateline>Tug crews in New South Wales (NSW),
Victoria and Western Australia yesterday lifted their ban on
foreign-flag ships carrying containers but NSW ports are still
being disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.
    The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented
the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.
The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration
Commission today.
    Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the
ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.
    The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week
of action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to
protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.

<title>ECUADOR SEEKS HALT TO PAYMENTS TO BANKS IN 1987</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, March 11 - </dateline>Ecuador, stricken by a severe earthquake,
is seeking through negotiations with private foreign banks to
postpone all payments due to them for the rest of the year,
Finance Minister Domingo Cordovez said.
    He said in a statement, "The idea with the foreign banks is
to obtain from them the best terms to give the Ecuadorean
economy a complete relief in the period of deferral of payments
on the foreign debt during the present year."
    The statement referred only to payments due to private
foreign banks, a senior government finance official told
Reuters.
    These creditors hold two-thirds of Ecuador's foreign debt
which totals 8.16 billion dlrs.
    It did not refer to debts maturing to foreign governments
and multilateral lending agencies, accounting for the remainder
of Ecuador's foreign debt, the official said.
    He said Ecuador owed the private foreign banks between 450
and 500 mln dlrs in interest payments for the rest of 1987 and
about 66 mln in principal payments maturing this year.
    Cordovez said Ecuador would seek new loans from
multilateral organisations. A World Bank mission was due here
soon to evaluate emergency loans, government officials said.
    Ecuador has also appealed for emergency aid from about 40
foreign governments.
    Government officials have calculated losses to the 1987
budget from last Thursday's earthquake at 926 mln dlrs.
    In 1986, Ecuador's total service on the foreign debt was
about 996 mln dlrs to all creditors.
    The quake ruptured Ecuador's main oil pipeline, suspending
crude exports for five months until the line is repaired. Oil
accounts for up to two-thirds of its total exports and up to 60
pct of total revenues. Before the tremor, Ecuador suspended
interest payments on January 31 to private foreign banks.
    Officials said they stopped interest payments due to a
cash-flow squeeze stemming from a slide in world oil prices,
which cut 1986 exports by about 25 pct to 2.18 billion dlrs.
    Ecuadorean finance officials have been in telephone contact
every day this week with some of the banks who sit on its
14-bank advisory committee, the senior government finance
official said. The committee represents the country's 400 or so
private foreign bank creditors.
    Cordovez also said in the statement, "The banks should
perceive that it is impossible at this moment to comply with
what was forseen."
    Cordovez added, Ecuador must make a new proposal in line
with the reality since the earthquake by seeking better options
of deferment and of softening the negotiation conditions."
    Interest payments fall due at least monthly to private
foreign banks.
    Ecuador's initial proposal earlier this year was to make
only one semi-annual or one annual interest payment this year.
    Under this proposal, it sought to defer interest payments
until June at the earliest, foreign bankers and government
officials here said.
    Ecuadorean officials held their last formal meeting with
the advisory committee in New York in January, but the
negotiations were suspended on January 16 due to the 12-hour
kidnapping of President Leon Febres Cordero by air force
paratroopers.
    The Red Cross says that least 300 people died and at least
4,000 are missing due to the earthquake.

the present foreign exchange market instability will not last

    He told reporters the major currency nations are determined
to continue their concerted intervention whenever necessary to
stave off speculative dollar selling in line with their
February 22 currency stability agreement in Paris.
    Sumita also said he did not see the recent dollar drop as
anything like a free-fall.

<title>U.S. COULD APPROVE EGYPTIAN M-1A TANK PRODUCTION</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 29 - </dateline>The U.S. Defense Department said it
has given preliminary approval for Egypt to produce the M-1A
tank, the main battle tank of the United States.
    The State and Defense Departments said talks were going on
between the two countries dealing with Egypt's ability to build
the tank and protect its high technology secrets.
    The U.S. Army signed a contract four weeks ago to pay
General Dynamics Corp <GD> 3.5 billion dlrs over the next four
years to build 3,299 of the tanks.
    Pentagon officials, who asked not to be identified, told
Reuters Congress probably will not be officially notified of
any final plan until after October 1. Congress would then have
30 days to veto Egypt as the first foreign co-producer of the
M-1A.
    U.S. defense officials said Congress could approve the plan
because Egypt is the only Arab country which has signed a peace
treaty with Israel. But they said the issues of technology
transfer and a possible loss of U.S. jobs could raise problems
for the plan while Israel would also be expected to lobby
against any production agreement.

<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 3 - </dateline>Standard and Poor's Corp said it
upgraded the ratings on four billion dlrs of debt of Coastal
Corp and its subsidiaries.
    S and P cited Coastal's success in reducing debt and
preferred stock by 390 mln dlrs last year, despite weak energy
prices. As debt is repaid, pretax interest coverage should rise
gradually from the current depressed 1.4 times level.
    Raised were Coastal's notes, debentures and Eurobonds to
BB-minus from B-plus and subordinated debt and preferred to
B-plus from B-minus. S and P upgraded the units Wycon Chemical
Corp and ANR Finance N.V./B.V.
    Wycon Chemical's industrial revenue bonds, guaranteed by
the parent, were raised to BB-minus from B-plus.
    S and P upgraded ANR Finance's Euronotes to BB-minus from
B-plus, ANR Pipeline Co's first mortgage bonds to BB-plus from
BB, debentures and Eurobonds to BB-minus from B-plus and
preferred to BB from B-plus.
    Also, Colorado Interstate Gas Co's first mortgage bonds
were raised to BB-plus from BB and debentures to BB-minus from
B-plus, while the unit's preferred was affirmed at BB.
    A manageable debt maturity schedule for the next few years
mitigates concern over Coastal's capital structure, S/P said.

<title>WORLD BANK EXPECTED TO APPROVE PHILIPPINES LOAN</title>
<author>    By Chaitanya Kalbag, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    MANILA, March 17 - </dateline>The World Bank is expected to approve a
310 mln dlr economic recovery loan for the Philippines at a
meeting of its executive board today in Washington, Central
Bank sources said.
    The sources said the loan, agreed upon in principle last
September during a visit to the United States by President
Corazon Aquino, had been held up by Philippine government
delays in fulfilling key conditions.
    They said the documents required by the World Bank were not
submitted by Manila until late February.
    The sources said the loan is needed to rehabilitate the the
state-owned Philippine National Bank (PNB) and the Development
Bank of the Philippines (DBP), which together are burdened with
seven billion dlrs of non-performing assets.
    They said the World Bank had insisted the two banks appoint
independent auditors and draft revised charters.
    It also laid down several conditions for an Asset
Privatisation Trust (APT) planned by the government to dispose
of the banks' unproductive assets, the sources said.
    The APT, set up in January, is headed by banker and
businessman David SyCip.
    The sources said the World Bank wanted respected private
sector individuals to be appointed to the APT, and immunity
from prosecution for the trust. It wanted a clause saying
buyers of non-performing assets could not be prosecuted.
    The Manila Standard newspaper quoted Rolando Arrivillaga,
World Bank representative in the Philippines, as saying the
loan would be in three 100 mln dlr tranches. The first tranche
would be available late this month or in early April.
    Arrivillaga said the remaining 10 mln dlrs was in the form
of technical assistance available for disbursement during a
36-month period.
    Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said approval of the
loan will trigger another 300 mln dlr loan expected from the
Export-Import Bank of Japan.
    The Central Bank sources said negotiations would start in
April on another 150 mln dlr loan from the World Bank to
implement reforms in the government corporate sector.
    The sources said the World Bank is expected to approve the
loan by August, after a review of the government's
non-financial institutions. The government's 14 major
corporations rely heavily on budgetary support to supplement
external borrowing to meet their yearly revenue shortfalls.

Association has decided not to raise its guarantee fee on
mortgage securities, Louis Gasper, Ginnie Mae executive vice
president said.
    Ginnie Mae, which guarantees securities backed by Federal
Housing Administration and Veterans Administration mortgages,
had planned to raise the fee March one from six basis points to
10 basis points. Mortgage bankers strongly opposed the proposed
fee increase.
    Gasper said it became apparent Congress was ready to pass
legislation that would have rescinded the fee increase.

<title>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - IRISH BUDGET</title>
<author>    By Paul Majendie, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    DUBLIN, March 27 - </dateline>New Irish Prime Minister Charles
Haughey, faced with a debt-ridden economy, will have to produce
a harsh budget next week to impress financial markets, appease
political opponents and maintain his tenuous hold on power,
analysts said.
    For Haughey, who failed to win an overall majority in last
month's election, only scraped back into power when the speaker
in parliament stepped in with his casting vote to decide a tied
vote on who would be the next Prime Minister.
    Heading a minority government and faced with a stagnant
economy weighed down by debt, he has little room for manoeuvre.
    The national debt has now reached 24.3 billion punts --
10,000 dlrs for every man, woman and child on the island and
per capita three times the size of Mexico's.
    Its 19 pct unemployment rate is one of the highest in the
European Community and 30,000 youngsters emigrate every year.
The 58 pct income tax level could hardly be raised again.
    Haughey, declining to be tied down on specifics, promised
on the election trail to get Ireland out of the debt trap with
an annual growth rate of 2.5 pct, compared to central bank
predictions of 1.5 pct. Jobs were his top priority, he said.
    For his crucial first budget, Haughey has ruled out any
increase in the level of government borrowing and forecast
"widespread cutbacks with severe restrictions right across the
board."
    Finance Minister Ray MacSharry also stressed that some of
the 187,000 civil service jobs must go to trim Ireland's annual
public wages bill of 2.84 billion punts.
    "The big question now is to what extent he will grasp the
nettle and cut in next Tuesday's budget," said Kevin Barry,
economist with National and City Brokers.
    "You have to cut the Exchequer Borrowing Recquirement (EBR)
substantially and swiftly. He has to do it now," Barry said.
    Noting that last year's EBR was 2.145 billion punts, he
said "Two billion would be good news. The markets are already
taking the view it is going to be tough."
    "He has absolutely no room to maneouvre. He cannot spend to
stimulate the economy. I don't see any good news in the
short-term."
    But he, like other analysts, rules out a debt-servicing
crisis that would mean calling in the International Monetary
Fund (IMF). "It's too easy to borrow aboard," he added.
    The steady rise of sterling, the currency of one of
Ireland's main trading partners, has been a boost to Irish
exporters with the country recording a 31 mln punt trade
surplus in February, the 10th surplus in a row.
    Political uncertainty is not a major factor for the punt
because the main political parties are all essentially
conservative with no major economic policy switches expected.
    New Fine Gael leader Alan Dukes, who replaced ousted Prime
Minister Garret Fitzgerald at the head of the main opposition
party, has pledged to back Haughey's budget if, as expected, he
gets tough.
    Haughey is four short of an overall majority and would have
to rely on the support of independent deputies if all four
opposition parties united to vote against him.
    But in today's climate of economic austerity, few
politicians would risk returning to the polls so soon and
Haughey could cling to power for at least another two years if
he brings in a belt-tightening budget next week, political
commentators say.
    The debt-laden economy is the great national preoccupation,
pushing firmly into the background for now Haughey's ultimate
dream of a united Ireland with the British out of the north.
    H.J. Heinz chairman Tony O'Reilly, one of the most
successful Irishmen in international business, stressed the
need for a frontal attack on the national debt, arguing "many of
our children have lost faith in the future."
    "Were there to be an uptick in world interest rates or a
precipitous decline in our parities, the effect on our economy
and on the provision of services by our government would be
catastrophic," he said.
    This island of 3.5 mln people has been living beyond its
means with a state spending spree on welfare benefits that
could not be financed by economic growth.

<title>ECUADOR TO USE COLOMBIA OIL LINK FOR FIVE YEARS</title>
<dateline>    BOGOTA, April 23 - </dateline>Ecuador will use a new pipeline link
with Colombia to export crude oil for the next five years,
Colombian mines and energy minister Guillermo Perry said.
    The link will be inaugurated on May 8. It was built to
allow Ecuador to resume exports of crude oil halted on March 5
by earthquake damage to its Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline,
    Once that pipeline is repaired, Ecuador will exceed its
OPEC quota in order to offset lost income and pay debts
contracted with Venezuela and Nigeria since the quake, Ecuador
mines and energy minister Javier Espinosa said.
    The two ministers were speaking at a news conference after
signing an agreement for joint oil exploration and exploitation
of the jungle border zone between the two nations. Drilling
will begin in September.
    "The agreement to transport Ecuadorean crude oil is not only
for this emergency period but for the next five years, with
possibility of an extension. Between 20,000 and 50,000 barrels
per day (bpd) will be pumped along it," Perry said.
    Espinosa said Ecuador planned to pump 35 mln barrels
through the link in the next five years, at a cost of 75 cents
per barrel during the first year.
    The 43-km link, with a maximum capacity of 50,000 bpd, will
run from Lago Agrio, the centre of of Ecuador's jungle
oilfields, to an existing Colombian pipeline that runs to the
Pacific port of Tumaco.
    Espinosa said the 32-km stretch of the link built on the
Ecuadorean side cost 10.5 mln dlrs. Perry gave no figures for
Colombia's 11 km segment but said it was "insignificant compared
with what we are going to earn."
    OPEC member Ecuador was pumping around 250,000 bpd before
the quake. Lost exports of 185,000 bpd are costing it 90 mln
dlrs per month, Espinosa said.

<title>ECUADOR SAYS IT WILL PAY DEBT WHEN IT CAN</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, March 14 - </dateline>President Leon Febres Cordero said
Ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make
payments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have
to be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments.
    Ecuador yesterday said last week's earthquake was forcing
it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the slide in
world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to private foreign
banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16 billion dlr foreign
debt.
    "All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour," the
president said during a visit to the quake zone. "A government
as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain."
    He said he had previously held that Ecuador was obliged to
make debt payments when crude oil was at 26 dlrs a barrel
because the government had projected plans with crude prices at
that level.
    Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil
would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able
to meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said.
    He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17
dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs
a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that.

<title>MALAYSIA BAILS OUT ANOTHER COMMERCIAL BANK</title>
<dateline>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 7 - </dateline>Malaysia's central bank said it
acquired a 59.2 pct stake in ailing <United Asian Bank Bhd>
(UAB), the sixth largest commercial bank in the country, to
rebuild public confidence in it.
    UAB called for a rights issue last November to raise 152.49
mln ringgit to rectify its capital deficiency following an
accumulated loss of 107.61 mln ringgit at end-1985, the central
bank, Bank Negara, said in a statement.
    But only 16.99 mln ringgit in shares was taken up by
shareholders, mainly local Indian and Malay businessmen and the
Indian Government.
    Bank Negara said it subsequently took up the unsubscribed
shares, totalling 135.5 mln of UAB's new paid-up capital of
228.74 mln ringgit.
    It said the shares, held in trust, will be eventually sold.
    The central bank early this week also announced that it had
bought 49.4 pct stake in another troubled commercial bank,
<Perwira Habib Bank Malaysia Bhd>, after the latter raised its
capital to 405 mln ringgit from 105 in mid-January this year.
    Bank Negara said it does not intend to hold on to the
shares of the two banks.
    "The injection of capital in PHB and in UAB including the
recamp of management in these banks are some of the measures
taken by the bank to strengthen public confidence in the
stability of the these banks," it added.
    The central bank said it is invoking Section 39A of the
Banking (Amendemnt) Act 1986 empowering it to grant loans to an
ailing bank or to buy a stake in it.

<title>VENEZUELA APPROVES WAGE INCREASES, PRICE CONTROLS</title>
<dateline>    CARACAS, April 29 - </dateline>Venezuelan president Jaime Lusinchi
approved a general wage increase in the form of bonuses ranging
from 20 to 30 pct and a 120-day price freeze on a basket of
basic consumer goods.
    Both measures, which take effect on May 1, were approved by
the cabinet. They will be announced to the nation by Lusinchi
in a televised address tonight but the text of the decrees was
released this afternoon.
    Businessmen, who met Lusinchi, opposed the pay rise, saying
it will fuel inflation. The inflation rate was 11.5 pct in 1986
and private economists say it will be 25 to 30 pct in 1987.
    The central bank said first quarter inflation was 6.3 pct.
    The wage increase for public and private sector employees
will be 30 pct on salaries of up to 2,100 bolivars a month. For
salaries of from 2,101 to 6,100 bolivars 25 pct and for those
of 6,101 to 20,000 bolivars 20 pct.
    The measures were taken in response to a request from the
Venezuelan confederation CTV for an increase to offset the loss
in the purchasing power of workers' salaries. It estimated the
loss at 40 pct.
    The general wage rise is the third granted by Lusinchi
since his government took office in February 1984.
    The wage increases are a bonus and will not be considered
in calculating benefits or severance pay, the decree said.
    At the same time, Lusinchi declared a freeze on lay-offs
and firings for the next 120 days.
    The price freeze applies to a group of 120 foods and other
consumer goods declared to be "of primary necessity."
    It does not apply to prices charged by agricultural
producers or to goods for which the price is falling.
    The decree establishes fines of between 1,000 and 500,000
bolivars for merchants who violate the price control measure.

<dateline>    NEWARK, N.J., April 13 - </dateline>New Jersey Bell, wholly owned by
Bell Atlantic Corp, said the Federal Communications Commission
will allow it to market its network service with equipment
provided by Bell Atlanticom Systems, an unregulated company
also wholly owned by Bell Atlantic.
    New Jersey Bell said the FCC ruling gives it interim relief
from current accounting restrictions until the company's plans
for complying with new accounting rules are approved by the
FCC.
    New Jersey Bell said the FCC ordered January one that
telephone companies could offer equipment as long as they
complied with new accounting rules that separate costs of
regulated service from unregulated activities.
    New Jersey Bell said the joint marketing program between it
and Bell Atlanticom Systems will apply initially to New Jersey
Bell's largest business customers.

<title>SOVIET SPRING CROPS SOWN ON ONLY 11 PCT OF LAND</title>
<dateline>    ****MOSCOW, April 29 - </dateline>Soviet farmers had sown spring crops
on only 15.8 mln hectares or 11 pct of cultivated land by April
27, compared with 26.2 mln ha by April 21, 1986, Izvestia said.
    Grains and pulses (except maize) were sown on 6.7 mln ha,
compared with 13.1 mln at the same time last year, it added.
    Spring sowing is off to a slow start, with planting two to
four weeks behind schedule in many areas of the Ukraine,
Byelorussia and Russia, because the winter was unusually cold.
    Western agricultural experts believe the crop could still
be good but heavy winterkill will make it difficult to reach
the 1987 grain target of 232 mln tonnes. The 1986 crop was 210
mln.

    In a separate press release, the company said that ENOF and
Almaden held talks in Istanbul a week ago with Turkish mercury

not in a position to say what action the Turkish companies
would be taking.

<title>CREDITOR BANKS MAY BUY INTO SINGAPORE COFFEE FIRM</title>
<dateline>    SINGAPORE, March 5 - </dateline>The nine creditor banks of the
Singapore coffee trader <Teck Hock and Co (Pte) Ltd> are
thinking of buying a controlling stake in the company
themselves, a creditor bank official said.
    Since last December the banks have been allowing the
company to postpone loan repayments while they try to find an
overseas commodity company to make an offer for the firm.
    At least one company has expressed interest and
negotiations are not yet over, banking sources said.
    However, the banks are now prepared to consider taking the
stake if they find an investor willing to inject six to seven
mln dlrs in the company but not take control, the banking
sources said.
    Teck Hock's financial adviser, Singapore International
Merchant Bankers Ltd (SIMBL), will work on the new proposal
with the creditor banks, they said.
    Major holdings are likely to be held by the two largest
creditor banks, Standard Chartered Bank <STCH.L> and
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd <OCBM.SI>, they added.
    Teck Hock owes over 100 mln Singapore dlrs and the creditor
banks earlier this week agreed to let Teck Hock fufill
profitable contracts to help balance earlier losses.
    The nine banks are Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd, United
Overseas Bank Ltd <UOBM.SI>, <Banque Paribas>, <Bangkok Bank
Ltd,> <Citibank NA>, Standard Chartered Bank Ltd, Algemene Bank
Nederland NV <ABNN.AS>, Banque Nationale De Paris <BNPP.PA> and
<Chase Manhattan Bank NA.>

<title>PAYLESS CASHWAYS <PCI> SEES BETTER FIRST QTR</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 6 - </dateline>Payless Cashways Inc chairman David
Stanley told analysts the company's first quarter results to be
reported March 17 will be better than the seven cts per share
reported in the year ago quarter.
    "It was not a wonderful sales quarter, but it only
represents 14 pct of the year's total results," Stanley said.
    Stanley also said that 1987 full year sales will be in
excess of 1.8 billion dlrs as compared to the 1.5 billion dlrs
reported in 1986. He also said that analysts' estimates of 1.55
dlr per shr for 1987 "are not crazy."
    Payless reported net income of 1.22 dlr per share in 1986.
    "The economy may not get a lot better, but we expect our
advantages in the lumber industry and cost cutting measures to
keep us competitive," Larry Kunz, chief financial officer,
said.
     The company acquired Knox Lumber Co for about 24.3 mln
dlrs in October 1986.
    Stanley said the company's stronger-than-optimal balance
sheet will enable it to make further acquisitions but no
negotiations are going on at the current time.
    He said some benefits of a new management information
system will be felt in 1987 and more substantially in 1988.

<title>CHINESE BANKS TO ISSUE MORE BONDS, OFFICIAL SAYS</title>
<dateline>    PEKING, March 2 - </dateline>China's state and collective firms do not
have enough cash to operate imported equipment, so banks will
issue more bonds to raise funds, a Chinese bank official was
quoted by the China Daily as saying.
    Xie was quoted as saying the present cash shortage means
some state firms do not run at full capacity and are
inefficient. The central government does not have enough money
to meet their needs.
    The paper said, "Reliable sources disclosed that the country
is running a budget deficit." It gave no figure.
    Xie said her bank sooner or later will have to punish the
many firms that have failed to repay loans made to them over
the past two years at high interest rates. The bank financed
the loans by issuing two billion yuan of bonds, but she gave no
other details.

<title>GUYANA FINANCE MINISTER OPTIMISTIC BUT SEEKS HELP</title>
<dateline>    MIAMI, March 25 - </dateline>Guyana hopes to overcome its financial
problems within three to five years and is now seeking help
from donor governments, Finance Minister Carl Greenidge said.
    He said Guyana took its problems in January to the
Caribbean Group for Cooperation and Development, which includes
governments and multilateral agencies, with a view to finding a
long-term recovery plan.
    Guyana's arrears to the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
are now 70 mln dlrs and it would not be eligible for new loans
in the near future, Greenidge told Reuters during the
Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) annual meeting here. MORE
    Greenidge also said a World Bank mission would visit
Georgetown this week to assess prospects for a rescue plan that
would enable Guyana to revive its economy. But he said the
government does not expect to be able to reduce its arrears
this year.
    Arrears to the IMF and the World Bank are projected to rise
to 100 mln dlrs by the end of 1987. About 90 mln dlrs of this,
equivalent to nearly half Guyana's annual exports, would be
owed to the IMF.
    "Expecting us to pay arrears is like asking a dying man to
give a pint of blood," Greenidge said.
    But Greenidge said Guyana has taken steps to reduce its
fiscal deficit, which now amounts to 65 pct of GDP. It has
increased taxes, reduced public expenditure and refinanced its
internal debt.
    He said the World Bank would meanwhile look at investment
requirements for potential export-earning projects such as gold
mining, timber, oil and kaolin.
    Because of its arrears, Guyana has been unable to draw down
a 40 mln dlr World Bank loan for a bauxite industry
rehabilitation project. Bauxite accounts for 90 mln dlrs of
exports, or 40 pct of the total.

<title>NYMEX SCHEDULES START OF HEATING OIL OPTIONS</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 2 - </dateline>The New York Mercantile Exchange said
options on heating oil futures will begin trading June 26.
    This would be the second options contract to trade at the
exchange. NYMEX introduced crude oil options last November.
    "Heating oil options are a logical complement to our
existing energy complex," said NYMEX Chairman William Bradt.
    "From our experience in crude, we fully expect heating oil
options to offer significant new trading opportunities to
current market participants and also draw additional users into
this marketplace," he said.
    Six consecutive trading months in heating oil options will
be introduced on June 26, led by the September 1987 contract,
according to the exchange.
    Strike prices wil be in increments of two cts per gallon
and seven strike prices for puts and for calls will be
available, the exchange said. The middle strike price will
correspond closely to the settlement price of the previous
day's futures close, it said.
    Expiration will be on the second Friday of the month
preceding delivery of the underlying futures contract, it said,
meaning that the September options contract would expire August
14.
    Prices for heating oil options will be quoted in cts per
gallon with a minimum fluctuation of 0.01 cent per gallon,
NYMEX said.
    The options will be based on the underlying futures
contract of 42,000 gallons each. Trading hours will be the same
as heating oil futures, beginning at 0950 EST and ending 1505
EST.
    NYMEX received approval for heating oil options from the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission on September 16, 1986, the
exchange said.

<title>AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN SHIP BAN ENDS BUT NSW PORTS HIT</title>
<dateline>    SYDNEY, April 8 - </dateline>Tug crews in New South Wales (NSW),
Victoria and Western Australia yesterday lifted their ban on
foreign-flag ships carrying containers but NSW ports are still
being disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.
    The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented
the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.
    The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration
Commission today.
    Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the
ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.
    The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week
of action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to
protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.
    The shipping sources said the various port unions appear to
be taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of
each shift and then to walk off.
    Cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, with
container movements most affected, but has not stopped
altogether, they said.
    They said they could not say how long the disruption will
go on and what effect it will have on shipping movements.

<title>U.S. SENATOR TO PROPOSE 0/92 FOR 1987 CROPS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 4 - </dateline>Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said he
intended to offer legislation that would allow 1987 producers
of wheat, feedgrains, cotton and rice to receive at least 92
pct of their deficiency payments, regardless of how much they
planted.
    Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee that
applying the so-called 0/92 provision to 1987 crops was
supported by the Reagan administration and would save
approximately 500 mln dlrs, including 266 mln dlrs in corn
payments, 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton.
    The Minnesota senator said he might offer the bill on the
Senate floor or in a conference committee with the House of
Representatives in the event a similar bill before the House
Agriculture Committee is approved by that body.
    Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U.S.
Agriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiency
payments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose not
to plant under the decoupling scheme.
    If payments are not set in advance under decoupling, market
prices conceivably could rise, thereby leading to diminished
deficiency payments.
    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.,
said he wanted to go to conference with the House as soon as
possible on the issue, but would have to study the matter
further before deciding how he would vote on it.

<title>JAPAN TO SCRUTINISE LIFE INSURERS' CAPITAL GAINS</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, Oct 20 - </dateline>The Finance Ministry plans to examine how
life insurance companies realised capital gains through
transactions undertaken in June, just before the yen bond
market began to fall sharply, a senior Ministry official said.
    The move is aimed at cooling fierce competition in the
field and will pave the way for a Ministry system to check that
insurers do not inflate investment returns on the accounts to
attract investors, he said.
    Some insurers transfer part of their unrealised gains from
general accounts to the variable life accounts, violating their
internal regulations, industry sources said.
    The eight major local life-insurers which offer variable
life policies here realised an average return of 21.01 pct on
such policies in the year ended September.
    The Ministry will scrutinise the policies of 17 local and
foreign life insurers which offer the variable life schemes.
    Japan has 23 major local life insurers, none of which is
listed on the stock market.

<title>SUZUKI MOTOR PLANS HUNGARIAN JOINT CAR VENTURE</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 24 - </dateline>Suzuki Motor Co Ltd <SZMT.T> is
negotiating a joint venture with Hungary to assemble compact
cars there following a request from its government, the first
entry by a Japanese car maker into a Communist country, a
Suzuki spokesman said.
    The company, in which General Motors Corp <GM.N> has a 4.9
pct stake, has to set up such projects to avoid cutting
component production in Japan. Existing overseas vehicle
projects are increasing local content and so using fewer
Japanese parts, the spokesman said.
    Its Indian joint venture <Maruti Udyog Ltd>, MUL, 26 pct
owned by Suzuki, will reduce component imports from Japan as it
increases local content to 60 pct from the present 40 pct in
1987, the spokesman said.
    The yen's continued rise against the dollar and Japan's
self-imposed restrictions on exports to the U.S. And Europe
were also to blame for cuts in car component manufacture in
Japan, he said.

<title>U.S. REAL GNP ROSE 1.1 PCT IN FOURTH QUARTER</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </dateline>The U.S. Gross National Product,
after removing the impact of inflation, increased at a revised
annual rate of 1.1 pct in the fourth quarter, the Commerce
Department said.
    That was down from an earlier preliminary 1.3 pct rise
estimated a month ago and down from the 2.1 pct rise in the
fourth quarter of 1985.
    The final fourth quarter revision, however, left unchanged
the previous estimate of a 2.5 pct increase in GNP for all of
1986 over 1985.
    The revised estimate for fourth quarter GNP partly
reflected a downward revision in inventories to a total
decrease of 28.5 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter, the
department said.
    The revisions also indicated personal consumption spending
decreased 2.2 billion dlrs in the fourth quarter after an
increase of 39.6 billion dlrs in the third quarter.
    Exports of goods and services rose 15.3 billion dlrs after
a decline of 9.4 billion dlrs in the third quarter. Imports
decreased 700 mln dlrs in the final quarter, in contrast to an
increase of 20.9 billion dlrs in the third quarter.

<title>STATOIL SEEKS SHARE IN THAI GAS FIELD</title>
<dateline>    STAVANGER, Norway, April 13 - </dateline>Norway's state oil company
Den Norske Stats Oljeselskap A/S (Statoil) <STAT.OL>, has told
Thai authorities it is interested in taking a 30 pct share in a
big offshore Thailand gas field, Statoil said.
    The field, in the southern sector of the Gulf of Thailand,
is currently operated by U.S. Oil company Texas Pacific Oil Co
Inc, a unit of Canada's Seagram Co Ltd <VO.N>. Thailand's state
oil company <Petroleum Authority Thailand> (PTT) also holds a
major stake in the field.
    PTT wants to develop the field and has asked Statoil to
consider co-development if the field's licence is renewed.
    PTT, according to Statoil, is currently negotiating with
Texas Pacific to buy back the Dallas-based oil company's
holdings in the field.
    "PTT must first sort out its problems with Texas Pacific.
When this is done, we have said we are interested in taking
over a 30 pct share in the field," Statoil spokesman Willy Olsen
told Reuters.
    Statoil, hired by PTT to carry out an independent appraisal
of the field's reserves and propose a development plan, has
estimated the field could be commercially developed at a cost
of some 700 mln crowns.
    Industry sources said Texas Pacific has submitted lower
reserve estimates for the field than Statoil and shown little
interest in its development. Statoil refused to disclose its
upgraded reserve estimate for the field.
    The field's reserves could be sold domestically through
Thailand's gas distribution network or by converting the gas to
electricity, the sources said.
    Sources would not say which field Statoil is considering.

<title>LEUCADIA <LUK> HAS 7.2 PCT OF MINSTAR <MNST></title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 2 - </dateline>Leucadia National Corp said two of
its subsidiaries have acquired a 7.2 pct stake in Minstar Inc,
a corporation controlled by corporate raider Irwin Jacobs and
used by him in his forays to acquire stock in companies.
    In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,
Leucadia said its LNC Investments Inc, a Newark, Del.,
investment firm, and Charter National Life Insurance Co, a St.
Louis joint stock life insurance company, bought their combined
1,261,000 Minstar common shares for investment purposes only.
    The Leucadia subsidiaries had held an 11.0 pct stake in
Minstar, but cut to 1.8 pct, or 313,200 shares, last July.
    Since July, Leucadia said its companies have bought 947,800
Minstar common shares for a total of 24.7 mln dlrs.
    Leucadia said it bought the Minstar stake to obtain an
equity position in the company and has no intention of seeking
control of it.
    Nearly half of Leucadia's common stock is owned by TLC
Associates, a Salt Lake City, Utah, general partnership, whose
partners include the chairman and president of Leucadia and
other investors.

<title>BRAZIL CROP WEATHER SUMMARY -- USDA/NOAA</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 31 - </dateline>Widespread rain interfered with
summer crop harvesting in Brazil's Rio Grande do Sul and
southern Mato Grosso do Sul in the week ended March 28, the
Joint Agricultural weather Facility of the U.S. Agriculture and
Commerce Departments said.
    In its International Weather and Crop Summary, the agency
said some rain fell in Parana, providing beneficial moisture to
immature soybeans and corn following a long hot, dry spell.
    Mostly dry weather prevailed in western Sao Paulo,
southwestern Minas Gerais, southern Goias and extreme eastern
Mato Grosso do Sul, it said.
    The agency said weekly temperatures again averaged near to
slightly above normal.
    In general, harvest progress likely was slowed by wet field
conditions over much of the region, it said.

<dateline>    MONTREAL, June 1 - </dateline>General Motors of Canada Ltd said it
will close its Montreal truck centre August 31, due to low
sales volume, putting most of the centre's 131 employees out of
work.
    "The sales volume at the centre has been insufficient to
support the operation," the company said in a statement.
    "With the recently announced joint venture with Volvo to
supply the heavy-duty truck market, customer requirements for
the GM line of light and medium duty trucks will be better
satisfied by GM dealers located throughout Quebec," the company
said.
    General Motors Canada said it will provide 52 weeks of
layoff benefits for most employees and up to 104 weeks for some
senior employees.

<title>ECUADOR ECONOMY SEEN CONTRACTING IN 1987</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, April 24 - </dateline>The Ecuadorean economy, struck by an
earthquake last month, will contract an estimated four pct in
1987 and its crude oil output will drop by 42 pct, the
government's national development council (Conade) said.
    A Conade report, dated April 21 and obtained, said that the
country's gross domestic product (gdp) would fall by an
estimated four pct compared to 1.5 pct growth last year. Conade
functions as the country's main planning institution.
    Crude output will fall to 61.2 mln barrels in 1987 from
105.6 mln in 1986, Conade said. It forecast exports of 22.9 mln
of crude and derivatives against 63.3 mln last year.
    The March five earthquake killed up to 1,000 people and
caused an estimated one billion dlrs in damage. It paralyzed
Ecuador's crude output because it ruptured the country's main
pipeline from Lago Agrio, at the heart of jungle oilfields, to
the Pacific Ocean port of Balao.
    It will take until at least end-July to repair the line and
return output to normal levels, oil officials said. Ecuador
output was about 250,000 barrels per day before the tremor.
    Conade forecast total 1987 exports of 1.77 billion dlrs,
572 mln dlrs of which would be oil and derivatives.
    Imports were forecast at 1.70 billion dlrs. Total 1986
exports were 2.18 billion dlrs, of which 979 mln dlrs were
crude and derivatives, with total imports 1.66 billion dlrs.
    Conade predicted that payments on Ecuador's 8.16 billion
dlrs foreign debt will be limited to 947 mln dlrs this year
against 1.489 billion dlrs last year. Conade's projected
ceiling on payments is not legally binding.
    The current account balance of payments deficit was seen at
934 mln dlrs in 1987. It was 696 mln dlrs in 1986.

<title>BRAZIL COMPUTER MARKET TO REMAIN CLOSED-MINISTER</title>
<dateline>    RIO DE JANEIRO, MARCH 24 - </dateline>Brazilian Science and Technology
Minister Renato Archer said Brazil will keep its computer
market closed to foreign goods in order to give its own infant
industry time to develop.
    "Every country establishes laws to protect its interests.
The United States closed their borders at a certain stage to
some foreign goods and therefore protected its industrial
development. Now it is time for Brazil to do likewise," Archer
said at the opening of a national software conference.
    After several meetings, Brazil and the U.S. Have made no
major progress in their computer row, which they have been
trying to resolve for the past 18 months.
    The Reagan administration has objected to Brazil protecting
its computer industry from imports.

<title>MCDONNELL <MD> SAID TALKS AT INFORMAL STAGE</title>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, March 9 - </dateline>McDonnell Douglas Corp said recent talks
with Airbus Industries about joint development and production
of a new jetliner with the European aircraft manufacturing
consortium have been very informal.
    "If there have been talks, they were casual at best," said
a source at the company. "There is nothing going on that would
lead to immediate or near-term collaboration" on a new plane.
    Senior officials at the aerospace firm's St. Louis
headquarters were unable to comment more specifically on
weekend published reports from Europe that talks about a joint
venture have resumed after they broke off last fall.
    McDonnell Douglas and Airbus last spring and summer had
discussed jointly developing and building a long-range aircraft
to compete with Boeing Co <BA> 747 wide-body jetliner, or its
successor. Talks ended when neither side wanted to forego plans
to launch its own widebody jetliner projects - McDonnell
Douglas with its MD-11 and Airbus with its A340.
    McDonnell Douglas has since launched the MD-11 jetliner, a
successor to its DC-10, and has more than 100 orders and
options.
    Airbus wants to launch its program this spring and is now
seeking customers for the long-range A340 and a companion
plane, the shorter-range A330.
    "I don't want to say we're not interested, because we are
in any collaboration that benefits McDonnell Douglas without it
giving up anything," the source told Reuters. "There just
haven't been in-depth discussions."
    He said any joint venture would not affect the MD-11
program already underway.
    McDonnell Douglas last month claimed Airbus tried to
overturn pledges made by airlines to buy the MD-11 by offering
cut-rate prices for the A340.
    The firm said Airbus, in an effort to line up enough
customers to launch the program, is engaging in "predatory
practices" with prices substantially below those needed to
recover the cost of developing and building the plane.
    U.S. government and aerospace industry officials believe
Airbus can offer low prices because the consortium gets
government subsidies that cover many of its costs.
    The Reagan Administration decided last month to consult the
General Agreement on Tariff and Trade, GATT, to determine
whether Airbus is unfairly subsidized. Under GATT rules an
enterprise can be subsidized but only if it will make a profit.
    U.S. officials say Airbus countries have poured 15 billion
dlrs into Airbus since the early 1970's and the consortium has
yet to make a profit.

<dateline>    STRASBOURG, March 12 - </dateline>The EC Commission said it was
adopting an "open attitude" about whether a system of production
quotas should remain for the indefinite future on heavy steel
products which account for about 45 pct of all EC steel goods.
    In a statement, the Commission reiterated its view that the
industry needs to lose between 25 and 30 mln tonnes of capacity
by 1990. It had previously said the quota system, started in
1980, should be wound up completely by the end of next year.
    The industry has argued for the maintenance of existing
quotas, which cover almost 70 pct of all output, saying almost
all steelmakers are losing money due to the depressed market.

<title>RUGBY WELL PREPARED FOR NEW CEMENT COMPETITION</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 30 - </dateline>Rugby Portland Cement Plc <RBYL.L> said
it was well placed to operate in the new circumstances
following the ending in February of the 53-year old cement
manufacturers common price and marketing arrangements.
    In a statement following the release of its 1986 results,
IT stated that the current year had started well. It reported
that pretax profits in the year rose to 35.46 mln stg from
21.84 mln previously on turnover higher at 313.3 mln after
252.2 mln.
    The strong recovery of the first six months continued into
the second half, although U.K. Cement demand rose only
modestly. Results benefitted from cost cutting and higher
volumes.
    The decision by the Cement Makers Federation to end the
pricing agreement reflected pressure from higher competition
due to growing imports and the possibility that the system
would be taken to the Restrictive Practices Court by the U.K.
Government. It stated that its John Carr unit benefitted from
strong organic growth, although overseas its Cockburn operation
had a difficult period with high maintenance costs and
increased depreciation charges.
    The company is proposing to change its name at the next
annual meeting to <Rugby Group Plc>.
    Rugby said it spent 27 mln stg on acquisitions in 1986. It
noted that its Western Australia hotels company had agreed to
sell the Parmelia hotel for 31.5 mln Australian dlrs, some
seven mln stg above end-1986 book value.
    The results were largely in line with forecasts and Rugby
shares were little changed at 242p after 241 at Friday's close.

<title>INVESTCORP SIGNS FOR 75 MLN DLR CREDIT FACILITY</title>
<dateline>    BAHRAIN, April 27 - </dateline><Arabian Investment Banking Corp EC>
(Investcorp) signed for a 75 mln dlr revolving credit facility,
one of the lead managers <Arab Banking Corp>, ABC, said.
    The facility was first mandated for 50 mln dlrs but was
increased before syndication to 60 mln when a lead group of six
banks was formed. Strong demand during syndication led to
another increase in the final amount to 75 mln dlrs.
    ABC said the facility, with a final lending syndicate of 32
banks from 13 countries, is part of Investcorp's strategy to
develop and diversify its source of funds and reduce its
borrowing costs.
    ABC as overall arranger said the facility will be used to
finance Bahrain-based Investcorp's general corporate funding
requirements. It can be exercised in three different ways.
    These are through the issue of euronotes or advances by
tender, the extension of committed advances by underwriting
banks, or the issue of contingent obligations from a panel of
selected banks.
    The facility has a maturity of three years, with interest
on committed advances based on utilisation from 17.5 basis
points over London Interbank Offered Rates for one third to 20
basis points for two thirds and 22.5 for an amount above that
level.

<title>SOVIET TRADE DEFICIT WITH WEST SOARS IN 1986</title>
<dateline>    MOSCOW, April 9 - </dateline>The Soviet trade deficit with the West
almost quadrupled last year, reaching 2.72 billion roubles
compared with 713 mln in 1985, official figures showed.
    Statistics published by the monthly journal Foreign Trade
showed Soviet trade turnover for 1986 fell to 130.9 billion
roubles from 142.1 billion the previous year, a drop of 7.8
pct.
    Moscow's trade surplus with East Bloc countries continued
to grow in 1986.
    Western analysts attributed the deficit rise with the West
to the world oil price slump, which hit Moscow's main export
and cut hard currency earnings needed for purchases in the
West.

<title>FORMER GOLD FIRM EXECUTIVES ARRESTED IN JAPAN</title>
<dateline>    OSAKA, Japan, March 21 - </dateline>The public prosecutors and police
here arrested five former senior executives of a bankrupt gold
deposit business group for defrauding about 450 clients of
about 1.5 billion yen for gold bars which were never delivered,
police said.
    The case involving the Toyota Shoji Company was highlighted
when its 32-year-old Chairman Kazuo Nagano was stabbed to death
here in public view in June, 1985.
    Television crews which had been waiting outside Nagano's
home filmed two men smashing their way into the home and later
emerging with a bloodstained bayonet.
    The company, established here in 1981, undertook to hold
gold on deposit for investors. It grew into a nationwide
business operation with 87 branch offices and 7,000 employees
at its peak in early 1985.
    Toyota Shoji's business group collected an estimated 200
billion yen from about 30,000 clients, many of them pensioners
and housewives, before the firm went bankrupt in July, 1985,
according to lawyers.
    Of them, some 18,000 clients claimed they could get back
neither gold or money, suffering an aggregate loss of 150
billion yen, local press reports said.
    Police said the five arrested on charge of fraud today
included Hiroshi Ishikawa, 47, former Toyota Shoji president,
and a sixth former executive was placed on a wanted list.
    They were suspected of having collaborated with the late
Nagano in swindling about 1.5 billion yen from about 450 people
in Osaka and nearby Kobe during a six month period just before
the firm's bankruptcy, they said.
    Today's arrest came after narly two years of joint
investigation by the public prosecutors and police, who had
questioned about 3,000 of the firm's former employees,
police sources said.

American and one Indian, said U.S. Hostage Alann Steen was ill
and offered to free him in exchange for a hundred detainees in
Israel.
    "U.S. Spy Alann Steen began to suffer from illness, his
health might deteriorate and he might die in 10 days," said a
hand-written statement by Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of
Palestine delivered to Beirut's independent An-Nahar newspaper.
    "Our humanitarian motives require that we free him for 100
detainees in the occupation jails," said the statement, which
was accompanied by a photograph of Steen.

<title>ANGLO CHIEF URGES S.AFRICA REPEAL DISCRIMINATION</title>
<dateline>    JOHANNESBURG, March 31 - </dateline>Anglo American Gold Investment Co
chairman Julian Thompson urged the South African government to
repeal legislation preventing black advancement in the mining
industry.
    Thompson, commenting in the annual report, said the mining
industry remained "cynical" about whether Pretoria really intends
to remove barriers which prevent blacks from holding skilled
jobs.
    He urged the government to back up pledges by introducing a
bill when parliament reconvenes later this year.
    The vast majority of South Africa's 600,000 miners are
black but whites perform most supervisory jobs.
    The government has vowed to open all mining jobs to all
races this year but the mining industry fears clauses inserted
in an abolition bill could be used to make it difficult for
blacks to qualify for skilled positions.
    "The reluctance of the government to repeal (discriminatory
provisions) obstructs the advancement of blacks and denies them
opportunities for taking increasing responsibilities," Thompson
said.

<dateline>    RANGOON, March 13 - </dateline>Burma's paddy production fell to 729.4
mln baskets in fiscal year 1986-1987 (to end March) from 737.3
mln in 1985-1986, a cabinet report to parliament said.
    A basket is a local measure equal to 46 lbs.
    Paddy output in 1984-1985 was 699.1 mln baskets, it said.
    Burma's "Green Revolution" sparked by the introduction of
high-yield variety paddy strains in the mid-1970s appears to
have hit a plateau with production levelling off over the past
two years, economists said.

<title>SAUDIS DROP CONDITION FOR OIL SALE TO BRAZIL</title>
<dateline>    RIO DE JANEIRO, MARCH 13 - </dateline>Saudi Arabia has dropped its
condition that Brazil secure international bank guarantees
before Saudia Arabia would ship it oil, the state-oil company,
Petrobras, said in a statement.
    Petrobras said the Saudis will accept Banco do Brasil
credit guarantees.
    Petrobras cancelled a 40-mln dlr crude oil purchase from
the Saudis yesterday after they refused to accept a letter of
credit from the official Bank of Brazil. The Saudis had
demanded that Brazil get credit guarantees from leading
international banks.
    Petrobras said the Saudis had been advised that if they did
not change their mind by Monday, Petrobras would negotiate the
purchase of oil with other producers.
    The Petrobras statement said the shipment of 2.2 mln
barrels will be made by the Saudis on March 24 as scheduled.
    The shipment is part contract signed in February for the
Saudis to supply Brazil with 125,000 barrels per day until
June.

<title>KAUFMAN SAYS GREENSPAN NOMINATION BAD FOR BONDS</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </dateline>Henry Kaufman, managing director of
Salomon Brothers Inc, said the nomination of economist Alan
Greenspan to replace Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul
Volcker is bearish in the near term for the fixed income and
currency markets.
    "The basic direction of interest rates is not changed. The
fundamental direction of interest rates continues to be upward,
interrupted by intermittent rallies," Kaufman said in a
statement. He said the implication for equity markets in
neutral to bullish.
    Kaufman said, "Unlike Paul Volcker, who entered the office
of the Federal Reserve chairman with strong credibility both
domestically and internationally, Mr Greenspan will have to
demonstrate both his competence and policy independence before
he can gain full confidence of the financial markets."
    Greenspan is most knowledgeable on the behavior of the U.S.
economy, while his professional skills in the international
area are much more limited, Kaufman noted.
    "Consequently, although he is well known abroad, his views
on issues such as the Less Developed Country Debt may initially
carry less weight than have those of Mr Volcker."

<title>TREASURY'S MULFORD SEES BRAZIL LENDING PROGRESS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 3 - </dateline>Assistant Treasury Secretary David
Mulford said rapid progress was being made in talks with
commercial banks for loans to Argentina, the Philippines and
Brazil.
    "This should result in substantial new lending for the
major debtors in 1987," he said in prepared testimony for the
Subcommittee on International Development Institutions of the
U.S. House of Representatives.
    Until recently, commercial banks were slow to conclude new
financing packages pending completion of a Mexican package,
Mulford said.
    "We are concerned about the backlog of other financial
packages and would like to see these move ahead soon," he said,
"There is some evidence that this is already happening.
    Chile signed an agreement with banks last week, and there
was also an agreement with Venezuela on rescheduling principal
payments on previously renegotiated debt.
    "We look for rapid progress in commercial bank discussions
with Argentina, the Philippines, and ultimately Brazil," he
said.

<title>VENEZUELA TO LEND UP TO 12.5 MLN BARRELS OF OIL</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, March 13 - </dateline>Venezuela will lend Ecuador up to 12.5
mln barrels of crude oil to help it meet its export commitments
and its domestic energy demand, Ecuadorean Energy and Mines
Minister Javier Espinosa said today in a statement.
    Ecuador was forced to suspend exports after the pipeline
connecting its jungle oil fields with the Pacific Ocean port of
Balao was damaged last week by an earthquake.
    Venezuela would lend 50,000 barrels per day of crude for a
total of up to to 7.5 mln barrels to help Ecuador meet export
commitments, Espinosa said. Also, Venezuela will sell the crude
and provide the foreign exchange earnings to Ecuador, he said.
     Ecuador would repay Venezuela in crude once it resumed its
exports after repairing its pipeline to Balao, a task that
would take an estimated five  months.
    Venezuela is lending Ecuador five mln barrels of crude for
refining in this country to meet domestic demand. Ecuador would
repay that loan with crude once the oil pipeline is repaired.
    Both countries are the only Latin American members of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
    Ecuador was exporting about 140,000 bpd before the
earthquake, Energy Ministry officials said. Its total output
was around 260,000 bpd.

<title>NIGERIAN CURRENCY FIRMS AT LATEST AUCTION</title>
<dateline>    LAGOS, March 5 - </dateline>The Nigerian naira firmed 2.6 pct against
the dollar after 17 banks were disqualified from bidding at
today's weekly foreign exchange auction, the central bank said.
The naira finished at 3.8050 to the dollar, against 3.9050 last
week.
    Only 38.39 mln dlrs of the 50 mln dlrs on offer was sold,
with all 27 bidding banks successfully obtaining hard currency.
    The effective rate, including a central bank levy, for
transactions in the coming week, was 3.8241 against 3.9246 last
week.
    The failure to sell the whole allocation was due to the
central bank's unprecedented disqualification of 17 banks as
punishment for inadequate documentation in previous
transactions.
    Banks are required to submit proof that their bids are
based on valid commercial transactions and the central bank has
complained in the past that many are failing to produce the
right paperwork within the specified time.

<title>BOLIVIAN DEBT BUYBACK PLAN GAINS GROUND</title>
<dateline>    MIAMI, March 25 - </dateline>Bolivia's proposal to repurchase at a
deep discount the 900 mln dlrs it owes to foreign commercial
banks is likely to be accepted, central bank governor Javier
Nogales Iturri said.
    Speaking to reporters at the annual meeting of the
Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) here, Nogales said
Bolivia's bank advisory committee, led by Bank of America, is
seeking permission from creditor banks worldwide to go ahead
with the scheme. More than 50 pct of the banks must give their
approval, and Nogales said he is confident that this threshold
will be reached.
    "It's working out very well, and I think we'll get clear
majority," Nogales said.
    A senior banker working on the deal also said that banks
are responding positively and said all the legal waivers
necessary could be obtained within two months.
    Bolivia halted all payments on its commercial bank debt in
March 1984. Hyperinflation has been curbed and public spending
trimmed, but its debt is still trading as low as 10 cts on the
dollar on the secondary market and many banks have written off
most, if not all, of their loans to the country.
    Bankers see little chance for a substantive recovery in
Bolivia's economic fortunes and so are willing to collect what
they can on the loans.
    Nogales said Bolivia would offer to buy back the debt at a
market price. He said some banks might want to hold out for a
higher price, but others would see the repurchase offer as a
window of opportunity to cut their losses.
    Bolivia intends to pay for the repurchase with aid that
foreign governments, especially the United States and West
Germany, are providing to help finance the eradication of coca
crops. Cocaine, although illegal, is Bolivia's largest export.
    The campaign to persuade farmers to grow legal crops
instead of coca would be financed instead using local currency,
Nogales said.
    Because the fiscal deficit has been reduced to some four
pct of gross domestic product, money supply could be increased
to pay for the drug-eradication drive without too much of n
impact on inflation, he added.
    Nogales said he did not expect Bolivia's debt repurchase to
become a model for other debtors in dire straits. "We're not
seeking a universal solution," he said."

<dateline>    LONDON, March 18 - </dateline>A total 60,500 tonnes of current series
white sugar received export rebates of a maximum 44.819
European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos at today's
European Community (EC) tender, the U.K. Intervention Board
said.
    Out of this, traders in France received 18,000 tonnes, in
Denmark 15,000, in West Germany 12,250, in the Netherlands
12,000 and in Belgium 3,250 tonnes, it added.
    Earlier today, London traders had expected the subsidy for
the current season whites campaign for licences to end-Aug to
be between 44.10 and 44.50 Ecus per 100 kilos.
    Traders had also forecast today's total authorised sugar
tonnage export awards to be between 60,000 and 70,000 tonnes
versus 71,000 last week when the restitution was 43.248 Ecus.
    Cumulative export authorisations for the current 1986/87
season now stand at 1,915,270 tonnes (40 weeks).

<title>TRADE ISSUES STRAINING EC'S PATIENCE WITH JAPAN</title>
<author>    By Gerrard Raven, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    BRUSSELS, April 13 - </dateline>Member states of the European
Community are starting to run out of patience with Japan which
they believe has repeatedly promised major initiatives to open
its market to imports, but as often made only minor moves.
    Diplomatic sources here said several recent actions by EC
countries bear witness to a new disillusionment with the
willingness, or at least the ability, of the Japanese
government to reduce its massive trade surplus with the EC.
    However, they said an all-out trade war may be far off, as
EC states know they would suffer almost as much as Japan.
    Senior EC diplomats gave a generally favourable reaction to
an EC executive commission proposal under which the EC could
raise tariffs on a range of Japanese products if the U.S.
Carries out a threat to make a similar move on April 17.
    The EC tariffs, which would involve renouncing obligations
entered into with the world trade body GATT, would be designed
to stop a diversion of exports to the EC market from that of
the U.S.
    The diplomats were meeting as Tokyo announced that the EC's
trade deficit with Japan reached a record 2.13 billion dlrs in
March, up from 1.94 billion in February.
    In 1986, Japanese exports to the EC totalled 30.67 billion
dlrs, up 4.5 pct from 1985, while EC exports to Japan fell one
pct to 12.43 billion dlrs.
    In Paris, trade minister Michel Noir said France has
decided to give Japan a taste of its own medicine.
    Burgeoning imports of microwave ovens and of frozen
Coquilles St Jacques will be restricted by a strict application
of French quality standards -- something EC states say often
happens to their own exports entering Japan.
    Britain has threatened to withdraw the licences of Japanese
banks and insurance companies to operate in the City of London,
because the British Cable and Wireless company lost out in
competition for a Japanese telecommucations contract.
    However, British officials in London have said that the
government may have gone too far in implying that it would take
immediate drastic action unless the contract was reopened.
    By contrast, West Germany, with the EC's most successful
economy, has never threatened Tokyo with sanctions, preferring
to rely on firm diplomacy and encouragement of its own
industries to surmount obstacles to export to Japan.
    The EC Commission itself has switched its tactics in recent
years, substituting general calls for action by Japan to open
its market with specific demands for moves in key areas.
    At present, it is, for instance, pressuring Japan to end
allegedly discriminatory taxation of imported wines and
spirits, to ensure EC companies have a chance to win contracts
for the building of a new international airport, and to
simplify certification and safety checks on imported cars.
    EC officials say these tactics yield some benefits, but
often the Japanese announce modifications of their non-tariff
barriers which open the door to imports by only a token amount.
    They stress, however, that any action must be taken by the
EC as a whole to stop beggar-my-neighbour action.
    One of the problems Britain could face if it were to
withdraw licences for Japanese banks would be that the bankers
would be welcomed with open arms in Frankfurt or Amsterdam,
they point out.

<title>GAF <GAF> SEEN RAISING BORG-WARNER <BOR> BID</title>
<author>    BY PATTI DOMM, REUTERS</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </dateline>GAF Corp, set on acquiring Borg-Warner
Corp's valuable plastics business, is believed by analysts to
be preparing an increased offer for the Chicago-based company.
     Yesterday, Borg-Warner said it agreed to be acquired for
4.23 billion dlrs by a company to be formed by Merrill Lynch
Capital Partners. Merrill offered 48.50 dlrs cash per share for
89 pct of Borg-Warner's common stock, and a package of cash and
securities for the balance.
    Borg-Warner stock rose 1-3/8 to 49-5/8.
    "I think it's (the stock price) telling us GAF is coming in
with another bid," said one analyst, who values the company at
51 or 52 dlrs per share.
    GAF has offered 46 dlrs per share. It holds 19.9 pct of
Borg-Warner's stock.
    "You're in a cat and mouse game on how you're going to up
the price. Obviously, nobody wants to pay more than you have
to. I think GAF is looking at the company the way we're looking
at it - that it's worth more," Pershing and Co analyst Richard
Henderson said.
    Henderson estimated it is worth abouth 55 dlrs per share.
    GAF has only said it was reviewing the situation. Merrill
Lynch officials did not return phone calls.
    Analysts have said they believe GAF Chairman Samuel Heyman
sought Borg-Warner because of its chemicals and plastics
business. The rigid plastics are used in such things as
telephones, computer terminals, and appliances.
    "Where the heck can you buy a world class chemical
operation these days," said Henderson.
    "He's (Heyman's) got the bucks. He's a heavy hitter, and he
does not like to get pushed around," said Henderson.
    GAF, a roofing and chemicals concern, attempted a takeover
of the much larger Union Carbide Corp two years ago. While GAF
did not win the company, it made a substantial gain on its
investment in Carbide.
    Analysts said GAF already has a large profit built into its
Borg-Warner holdings. They said even if GAF raises its offer
and does not succeed, a higher bid from another company would
give GAF millions of dollars in profits on its stock.
    "It's a win-win situation," said one analyst.
    One analyst speculated an offer from GAF would be
forthcoming shortly.
    "I think we are finally down to the final paragraph in this
book," he said.
    Borg-Warner's other businesses include automotive parts,
protective services, which includes Wells Fargo security
guards, and Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
    Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer and Co analyst who follows
GAF, said if GAF were to sell into the Merrill Lynch offer, it
would realize about 125 mln dlrs net profit, or about 3.50 per
share.
    "I think there's a probability he goes up in price," said
Rose.
    Rose said, however, he could not really predict what Heyman
would do. "Sam's a low-risk, high-return player."
    "Is he trying to build a major industrial chemical
enterprise, or is he trying to be an investment bank," Rose
said.
    Analysts said Borg-Warner's chemical business would add
earnings momentum to GAF. "I worked out that paying as much as
50 dlrs per share would still be additive to GAF in time, if
they sold off most of the non-chemical facilities," said John
Henry of E.F. Hutton.
    Borg-Warner's chemical and plastics business provided 1986
operating profits of 153.3 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.04 billion
dlrs. Total operating profits were 349.7 mln dlrs, and net
earnings were 206.3 mln dlrs for 1986.
    "The Borg chemical business is great," said Rose, adding
its only U.S. competitors are Monsanto Co <MCT> and Dow
Chemical Co <DOW>.

<dateline>    KUALA LUMPUR, March 28 - </dateline>Malaysia said it expects a natural
rubber shortage in April and May because of the effects of
current wintering on rubber trees.
    The expected shortage and stronger demand for rubber goods,
especially condoms and surgical gloves by consumers, is likely
to push up prices, the Malaysian Rubber Exchange and Licensing
Board said in its latest monthly bulletin.
    During the annual wintering period from February to April
rubber trees shed their leaves and latex output is very low.

leaving the company with a net worth of 633,581 dlrs at the end
of December.
    At the end of November, a spokesman noted, CCR did not meet
NASDAQ's requirement of a net worth of 100,000 dlrs and has
been trading on an exception to those rules.

<dateline>    CHICAGO, April 7 - </dateline>Live Hog futures ran up for gains of
0.57 to 0.07 cent in eary trade paced by April and June.
    Fairly active demand reflected strength in cash hogs and
the continued discount of futures to cash. The start of
fieldwork limited farmer movement of hogs to market and
prompted packers to bid up for hogs. Mostly steady to firm cash
pork products added to support, traders said.
    However, prices slipped from the highs in latest trade as
commercial profit-taking developed. Some selling was also
attributed to expectations that cash ham prices will be falling
soon on a seasonal basis, they said.
    Thomson and RBH bought while Packers Trading and Refco
sold. Stotler spread long June/short April, they added.

<title>UK MINISTER SAYS FARM TALKS CAN USE OECD STUDY</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 18 - </dateline>U.K. Agriculture Minister Michael
Jopling said an OECD study which calculates the level of
domestic farm subsidies in industrial countries would be a good
basis for global agriculture negotiations now underway.
    The controversial study, which has not yet been released by
the Paris-based OECD, has calculated a measure of farm
subsidies called the the Producer Subsidy Equivalent, PSE, OECD
sources in Paris said last month.
    Jopling, in a speech to the Commodity Club yesterday,
suggested the PSE be refined as a starting point for reducing
domestic farm policies during the Uruguay round of trade
negotiations begun under the world trade agreement GATT.
    The OECD study shows that there are few countries which do
not significantly subsidize farmers, Jopling said.
    The OECD study attempts to measure all farm subsidies for
the years 1979 through 1981.
    Jopling qualified his endorsement of the PSE as a
negotiating tool, however, by saying the European Community
would want "credit" in the negotiations for recent actions
taken to reform the Common Agricultural Policy.
    Representatives of other industrial countries told Reuters
they are more skeptical than the U.K. about the PSE concept.
    An Australian trade official said Canberra has "grave
technical reservations" about the use of the PSE calculations.
U.S. officials said there are several shortcomings to the study
including the necessity to update the calculations to reflect
recent changes in farm programs worldwide.
    The officials said the study may be released in May.

<title>GREYCOAT GROUP SEEKS TWO FINANCINGS</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, April 9 - </dateline>U.K. Property company Greycoat Group Plc
is seeking two financings, one for 120 mln stg and the other
for 16 mln stg, in connection with its Embankment Place
development above and around Charing Cross station in London,
banking sources said.
    The first transaction, a 120 mln stg credit, will be
arranged by N.M. Rothschild and Sons Ltd and Bank of Tokyo
International Ltd on behalf of a special purpose Greycoat
subsidiary yet to be incorporated.
    It matures in June 1993 but will be extendible by up to two
years to June 1995 at the option of the borrower.
    The first credit, a project financing, will carry a basic
margin of 5/8 point over London Interbank Offered Rates
(LIBOR), with an additional 1/4 pct per annum payable on
outstanding amounts to the extent that the property is not
substantially pre-let.
    In addition, if the property is pre-sold while amounts are
still outstanding, the basic margin will be reduced to 1/2
point over LIBOR, the banking sources said.
    For a one year extension of the maturity an extra 1/8 point
margin will be paid, with a further 1/8 point if the maturity
is lengthened for the optional second year.
    There will be a commitment fee of 1/4 pct per annum on
available amounts and of 1/8 pct on unavailable amounts, the
sources said. Rothschild is sole agent for this transaction.
    The second transaction, a 16 mln stg credit for the purpose
of working capital, is being arranged by Rothschild alone on
behalf of the Greycoat Group Plc itself. It will be secured on
a property called Brettenham House.
    The margin will be 1/2 point over LIBOR in years one to
four, 5/8 point over LIBOR in years five and six and 3/4 point
over LIBOR thereafter. The credit will mature in June, 1995.
    The sources said that a commitment fee of 20 basis points
will be payable on the available tranche, with 10 basis points
on unavailable amounts.

<title>GM <GM> CANADA UNIT MAJOR OFFER ACCEPTED BY UNION</title>
<dateline>    TORONTO, Oct 19 - </dateline>The Canadian Auto Workers' Union said it
accepted an economic offer from the Canadian division of
General Motors Corp <GM> in contract negotiations.
    But union president Bob White said many local issues at the
11 plants in Ontario and Quebec still remained unresolved ahead
of Thursday's deadline for a strike by 40,000 workers.
    "It minimizes the possibility of a strike," White told
reporters.
    However, "if we don't have local agreements settled by
Thursday, there will be a strike," he said.
    The local issues still unresolved involved health care,
skilled trades and job classifications, White said.
    GM Canada negotiator Rick Curd said he believed a strike
would be avoided.
    "Even though there are some tough issues to be resolved
we're on the right schedule to meet the target," Curd said.
    "I'm very pleased with the state of the negotiations," he
said.
    Union membership meetings have been scheduled for the
weekend in case a tentative settlement, said White.
    White said the union has also received assurances that a
job protection pact negotiated with GM workers in the U.S. does
not threaten Canadian jobs.
    The economic offer for a three-year pact largely matches
agreements at Ford <F> and Chrysler <C> in Canada, which
include inflation-indexed payments for future retirees and
fixed annual payments for current retirees.
    It also gives workers wage increases of three pct
immediately and 1.5 pct in each of the second and third years.

<title>YEUTTER SAYS U.S.-JAPAN TRADE DIFFICULTIES REMAIN</title>
<dateline>    TAUPO, New Zealand, March 24 - </dateline>U.S. Trade Representative
Clayton Yeutter said he was unsure whether some of the trade
issues straining U.S.-Japanese relations would be resolved
before the two countries open trade talks in late April.
    "We are having high level discussions on them (the issues)
within the United States...The relationship on some of those is
very strained between us (Japan) at the moment and we need to
relieve those strains at the earliest possible date," he said.
    "I am not sure we can wait until late April," he added.
    Yeutter is in New Zealand for a two-day informal meeting of
trade ministers who are reviewing the Uruguay round of the
General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT).
    He said he will meet the Japanese delegation over the next
few days but declined to discuss methods of relieving the
strain between the two countries.
    Yeutter said earlier the three most contentious trade
issues were semiconductors, Japanese government unwillingness
to allow public entities to buy U.S. Super-computers and the
barring of U.S. Firms from the eight billion U.S. Dlr Kansai
airport project near Osaka.
    The Japanese delegation to the GATT talks said in a
statement yesterday they are making major efforts to dismantle
trade barriers in their country.
    "I am convinced that they are attempting to move their
policies in the right direction. The question is how far and
how fast," Yeutter said.

the company has been a rumored takeover target for a while, and
a restructuring would probably be a defensive move to thwart an

<title>POLL SHOWS AMERICANS HOLD ON TO STOCKS AFTER DROP</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, Oct 20 - </dateline>The "Black Monday" stock market crash
failed to destroy Americans' faith in the economic soundness of
the country, according to a poll released on Tuesday.
    The ABC-Washington Post poll, taken after the close of
stock trading on Monday, showed 58 pct did not believe the
unprecedented slide in stock prices foretold an economic
downturn, and 70 pct rejected the notion the country faced a
1930s-style Depression.
    Fifty-three pct of those interviewed said they had owned
stocks at some point, and only one pct said they had sold any
as a result of Monday's decline.
    Of the 40 pct who currently held stocks, only two pct said
they planned to sell some and four pct said they planned to
buy.
    The poll of 507 men and women was taken by telephone on
Monday night, after the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged
more than 500 points, or 22 pct, in record volume.

<dateline>    LUDWIGSHAFEN, West Germany, March 25 - </dateline>BASF AG <BASF.F>
said net profit of its U.S. Operating company, BASF Corp, rose
last calendar year to 105 mln dlrs from 39 mln in 1985.
    Turnover rose by by more than one billion dlrs to 3.6
billion, the parent company said in a statement. The rise,
however, partly reflected the inclusion of the first full
business year of three acquisitions made in 1985. Excluding
these, BASF Corp turnover rose four pct from 1985.
    Acquisitions were the high-performance connecting materials
operations of Celanese Corp, Inmont Corp bought from United
Technologies and American Enka bought from AKZO NV <AKZO.AS>.
    BASF said it expected a U.S. Investment of 240 mln dlrs in
1987, part of a five-year programme totalling one billion.
    U.S. Projects completed in 1986 included the second acrylic
acid plant in Freeport, Texas, a technical centre in
Southfield, Michigan, in which paint lines from automotive
plants can be refitted, and the new agricultural research
centre in Research Triangle Park in Durham, North Carolina.
    BASF said that work this year had begun in Geismar,
Louisiana, on plants for production of special amines and
polytetrahydrofuran, as well as for expansion of capacity for
producing tetrahydrofuran.

<title>ASIAN COCOA PRODUCERS EXPAND DESPITE CRITICS</title>
<author>    By Jeremy Clift</author>
<dateline>    JAKARTA, Oct 20 - </dateline>Asian cocoa producers are expanding
output despite depressed world prices and they dismiss
suggestions in the London market that their cocoa is inferior.
    "Leading cocoa producers are trying to protect their market
from our product," said a spokesman for Indonesia's directorate
general of plantations. "We're happy about our long-term future."
    Malaysian growers said they would try to expand sales in
Asia and the United States if Malaysian cocoa was not suitable
for European tastes.
    They were responding to comments by London traders that
large tonnages of unwanted cocoa beans from Malaysia, Indonesia
and Papua New Guinea (PNG) were helping to depress cocoa
prices.
    London traders said the Asian cocoa was considered
unsuitable for western palates because of an acrid odour and a
high level of free fatty acids.
    Ng Siew Kee, the chairman of Malaysia's Cocoa Growers'
Council, said Malaysia should expand its sales to Asia and the
United States if it did not produce a type suitable for Western
Europe.
    A spokesman for the PNG Cocoa Industry Board said the
London market was mistaken if it linked PNG cocoa with
high-acid Malaysian and Indonesian beans.
    "When the market is declining, buyers seize on anything to
talk down prices," the spokesman said.
    He said that PNG could sell whatever cocoa it produces.
    PNG exported 33,000 tonnes of cocoa in the 1986/87 cocoa
year ending September 30, of which nearly 50 pct was exported
to West Germany, 16 pct to the U.S. And the rest to the
Netherlands and Britain.
    The Indonesia spokesman, an Agriculture Ministry official
who wished not to be identified, said Indonesia had no problem
with quality and would continue to expand sales. He described
criticism of the quality of Indonesian beans as "trade politics"
and said Jakarta's traditional links with Dutch buyers meant it
did not have any difficulty with exports.
    Indonesia and Malaysia, Asia's two biggest commodity
producers, are expanding cocoa output and are both outside the
International Cocoa Organization (ICCO).
    Officials have said Malaysian production is expected to
total 150,000 to 155,000 tonnes in calendar 1987.
    This is up from 131,000 tonnes in 1986, partly because of
the end of a three-year drought in Sabah, the country's largest
cocoa growing area.
    Production of Indonesian cocoa beans tripled to 31,600
tonnes in calendar 1986 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. Output is
projected to rise to 50,000 tonnes in 1988 from 38,000 tonnes
this year as young trees mature.
    Both Malaysia and Indonesia are low cost producers and
traders said they could last out low prices longer than West
African countries.
    According to one Kuala Lumpur trader, world prices would
have to fall another 1,000 ringgit per tonne (about 250 stg) to
make cocoa production in Malaysia uneconomic.
    Some traders believe the main quality problem is with
harvesting and fermentation techniques.
    One trader said Malaysian cocoa is virtually
indistinguishable from West African output if treated in the
same way but this is not possible on the larger Malaysian
estates.

<title>H.K. STOCK EXCHANGE MULLS NEW RULE FOR "B" SHARES</title>
<dateline>    HONG KONG, April 2 - </dateline>The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is
considering new rules governing different classes of shares
following a spate of new "B" share issues by leading local firms,
exchange chairman Ronald Li said.
    He told reporters the rules will allow settlement of "A"
share transactions with cheaper "B" shares at a ratio equivalent
to their par values. But "A" shares cannot be used to settle
transactions of "B" shares.
    Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd <JARD.HK>, Cheung Kong
(Holdings) Ltd <CKGH.HK> and Hutchison Whampoa Ltd <HWHH.HK>
have all announced proposals for issuing "B" shares.
    These would have substantially reduced par values but would
have voting rights equal to the existing shares or "A" shares.
    Li said the exchange does not want to restrict the issue of
"B" shares but it is concerned about huge discrepancies between
market prices of existing "A" and "B" stocks.
    The exchange said yesterday it will not accept further
proposals by listed firms to issue such new shares.
    Li said that if the exchange did not take action numerous
other companies would make similar issues. <Evergo Industrial
Enterprise Ltd>, now suspended from trading, has already made
such a proposal, he added.
    Li said the exchange will consult legal advisers in Britain
for the proposals from Cheung Kong, Hutchison and Jardine
Matheson. If the rules of settlement cannot be implemented, the
three firms must present alternative methods to guarantee
reasonable price differentials between the "A" and "B" shares.
    Both Jardine and Hutchison declined comment. But local
newspapers quoted Cheung Kong's director Albert Chow as saying
the firm will withdraw its issue if the new rule is approved.
    Analysts have said the "B" shares are designed largely to
protect the interests of majority shareholders. There is little
liquidity in them and they trade at big discounts.
    Stock brokers noted the "A" shares of Swire Pacific Ltd
<SWPC.HK> closed at 22 H.K. Dlrs today while the "B" shares ended
at 3.95 dlrs. The stocks have a par value of 60 and 12 cents
respectively, or a one-to-five ratio. At those levels that
represents an "A" share premium of about 11.4 pct over the "B"
shares.
    Li said the exchange has not considered any measures
against existing "B" stocks. Other existing "B" stocks are all
issued by units of Wharf (Holdings) Ltd <KOWL.HK>, including
<Hong Kong Realty and Trust Co Ltd>, <Lane Crawford Holdings
Ltd> and <Realty Development Corp Ltd>.

<title>REAGAN READY TO IMPOSE TRADE CURBS AGAINST JAPAN</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 27 - </dateline>President Reagan was ready to impose
retaliatory trade action against Japan for breaking its
semiconductor agreement with the United States, White House
officials said.
    There was no immediate indication when Reagan might act on
the recommendations of his Economic Policy Council to curb
Japanese exports to the United States, but officials said the
move could come today or early next week.
    Trade sources said the actions being weighed by Reagan
include tariffs on a wide variety of Japanese exports which use
semiconductors.
    The sources said the tariffs could be slapped on personal
computers, television receivers and laser-printers, with the
aim of penalizing Japan's major electronic firms, including NEC
Corp, Hitachi Ltd, Toshiba Corp and Fujitsu Ltd.
    They said Reaan could also delay invoking sanctions for a
week or two, giving Japan a final opportunity to end the
dumping practice, but added that negotiators had already held
extensive talks with the Japanese to no avail.

<dateline>    BEVERLY HILLS, June 18 - </dateline>Great Western Financial Corp said
it is offering 2,513,200 common shares at a price of 20.625
dlrs per share.
    The company said the shares are being offered in connection
with the conversion of SunPoint Savings Bank FSB of Lake Worth
Fla to stock from mutual form and its simultaneous merger into
Great Western Bank, a federal savings bank owned by Great
Western Financial.
    Great Western Bank said it has received Federal Home Loan
Bank Board approval to acquire SunPoint Savings, which has
assets of about 730 mln dlrs.
   
    Great Western noted the conversion merger recently won the
approval of 94 pct of SunPoint's members -- a group comprising
the depositors and borrowers of that company. The merger is
expected to be completed by June 25.
    Great Western said depositors and employees of SunPoint
will purchase 56,500 shares of Great Western's common at the
same price in a subscription offering. Proceeds of both the
public and subscription offerings will be contributed to Great
Western Bank and used in its lending operations.
    The offering will be underwritten by Shearson Lehman
Brothers Inc and Goldman Sachs and Co.

<title>U.K. MONEY RATES FIRM ON LAWSON STERLING TARGETS</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, April 2 - </dateline>Interest rates on the London money market
were slightly firmer on news U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson had stated target rates for sterling against the
dollar and mark, dealers said.
    They said this had come as a surprise and expected the
targets, 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs, to be promptly tested in the
foreign exchange markets. Sterling opened 0.3 points lower in
trade weighted terms at 71.3.
    Dealers noted the chancellor said he would achieve his
goals on sterling by a combination of intervention in currency
markets and interest rates.
    Operators feel the foreign exchanges are likely to test
sterling on the downside and that this seems to make a fall in
U.K. Base lending rates even less likely in the near term,
dealers said.
    The feeling remains in the market, however, that
fundamental factors have not really changed and that a rise in
U.K. Interest rates is not very likely. The market is expected
to continue at around these levels, reflecting the current 10
pct base rate level, for some time.
    The key three months interbank rate was 1/16 point firmer
at 10 9-7/8 pct.

<title>PHELPS DODGE <PD> SEES STRONGER COPPER PRICES</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 2 - </dateline>Phelps Dodge Corp officials said good
fundamentals in copper markets should lead to improving prices
for the metal.
    In an interview with Reuters, chairman G. Robert Durham
said continued strong demand and low inventories pushed prices
up eight to nine pct on the New York Commodities Exchange last
month.
    "Our customers in this country are living off the tailgates
of our trucks," he said, referring to tightness of supply and
strong demand. "The fundamentals are good."
   
    Asked if metal prices will continue to rise, Durham said;
"All I know is, fundamentals cannot be ignored."
    He said copper supplies are lower than they have been for
almost 20 years. Last year, copper demand was second highest on
record behind 1984, he said.
    Phelps Dodge is the nation's largest copper company, with
annual production expected to reach 500,000 tons this year.
   
    During the interview, executive vice president Douglas
Yearley said he believed it was only a matter of time before
the copper price rose "because there aren't that many new
projects coming on, and demand, short of a major recession,
will continue to grow modestly."
    Copper for July delivery rose more than two cts a pound to
more than 69 cents in Comex trading today. A one cent a pound
rise in copper prices yields 10 mln dlrs in annual earnings for
Phelps Dodge, the company said.
    "Demand has been surprisingly good in 1987, in construction
and other areas," Yearley said.
   
    New production later this year from a Bingham, Utah, mine
owned by Kennecott Corp, a unit of British Petroleum Co PLC's
<BP> Standard Oil Co, a mine in New Guinea and Phelps Dodge's
own expanded Morenci, Ariz., mine will be offset by production
shortfalls in Mexico and Zambia, he said.
    Durham said production costs at the New Mexico-located
Chino mine will be in line with conventional copper production
at the company's other mines by the fourth quarter. The
company's total production costs, including depreciation but
before interest and corporate expense, should be below 50 cts a
pound by late 1989 or 1990, he said.

<title>DIGITAL AUDIO TAPE PLAYERS GO ON SALE IN JAPAN</title>
<author>    By Steven Brull, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 2 - </dateline>Japanese consumers hesitated about buying
the controversial digital audio tape player (DAT) as it went on
sale in Tokyo today, but said the DAT player's near-perfect
sound will make it a success once it becomes cheaper.
    "The sound is great, but I'll wait until more machines hit
the market and prices fall to about 100,000 yen before buying
one," said Terumi Fujitsuka, 35, a steel firm employee.
    Aiwa, Sharp and Matsushita displayed their DAT players
today although delivery will take about two weeks, retailers
said. Aiwa's machine, the cheapest, is listed at 188,000 yen.
    Machines by Sony, Hitachi, Toshiba and others will appear
as early as the end of March, industry sources said.
    DAT players can play back and record with fidelity superior
to even a compact disc. They use a cassette half the size of
the standard audio cassette and unlike conventional analogue
machines, they can make copies an infinite number of times with
almost no loss of sound quality.
    This aroused fears in the music industry of widespread tape
piracy and loss of royalties. In negotiations that delayed the
DAT player's debut, the industry demanded anti-piracy circuitry
be built into the machines.
    Machines sold in Japan are fitted with a computer chip to
prevent copying through a digital signal. But copies can still
be made if the signal is routed through a regular amplifier.
"Nobody can tell the difference," one salesman said.
    DAT players have been kept off Western markets and some
countries are considering banning them or imposing heavy duties
unless tougher anti-piracy circuitry is added. But Japanese
hardware makers, hard pressed for profits in the era of the
high yen and growing competition, are eager to carve out a
profitable niche.
    Prices of DAT players will probably fall quickly, possibly
to around 70,000 yen by next year as other makers put their
products on the market, industry analysts said.
    They said by 1990, sales could reach six mln units per
year.
    Philips of the Netherlands has said it will launch its DAT
player on the world market later this year.

<title>BRITAIN CALLS FOR FIGHT AGAINST PROTECTIONISM</title>
<dateline>    BANGKOK, April 21 - </dateline>British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe called on industrial and developing countries to combat
trade protectionism and remove barriers which impede free
trading in agricultural products.
    Howe said in an address to the annual meeting of the U.N.
Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)
that success in fighting protectionism hinges on the current
Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
    He said Britain is committed to resisting and combatting
protectionism because free trade is vital to Britain where 30
pct of the gnp comes from trade in goods and services.
    Howe urged developing countries to open up their markets,
remove measures distorting free trade in services and provide
protection for intellectual property rights.
    He said industrial nations should also adopt macro-economic
policies which help reduce trade imbalances and promote stable
currency relationships.
    Howe said the agricultural industry, plagued by surpluses
and falling commodity prices in recent years, is over
subsidised and over protected. But the problem of farm
surpluses must be tackled despite the fact that it is
politically difficult for any government to reverse the trend
of growing farm subsidies.
    "This problem of over-subsidisation and over-protection of
agriculture will dog us in the years ahead and it will need the
sustained application of all our energy and our imagination to
find solutions," Howe said.

<title>YUGOSLAV 1990 STEEL OUTPUT TO HIT 6.3 MLN TONNES</title>
<dateline>    BELGRADE, March 14 - </dateline>Yugoslavian steel output will rise by
one mln tonnes to 6.3 mln tonnes a year between 1986 and 1990
under a development program adopted by the Yugoslav Iron and
Steel Metallurgy Association, the official Tanjug news agency
said.
    The association groups together the main Yugoslav iron and
steel enterprises.
    Extraction of iron ore should show an annual growth rate of
nine pct and reach seven mln tonnes by 1990 under the program.
Iron output is planned to grow at eight pct a year, reaching
4.5 mln tonnes at the end of the decade.
    Tanjug said the programme would create conditions for
raising exports of finished steel products.
    The main Yugoslav steel producers plan to market 5.35 mln
tonnes of steel goods this year, or 150,000 tonnes more than
last year, with 1.5 mln tonnes going to export.

<title><SAPC INC> SUES LOTUS <LOTS> OVER COPYRIGHT</title>
<dateline>    CAMBRIDGE, Mass., April 9 - </dateline>Privately-held software
developer SAPC Inc said it has filed suit in U.S. District
Court in Boston against Lotus Development Corp, alleging the
infringement of a copyright and the misappropriation of trade
secrets and is seeking 100 mln dlrs in damages.
    The firm's suit alleges that Lotus' spreadsheet program
1-2-3 violates the copyright of VisiCalc, which was developed
by SAPC several years ago, before 1-2-3 was introduced, when
the firm was known as Software Arts Inc.  Software Arts sold
rights to VisiCalc to Lotus in 1985 and changed its name.
    The suit also alleges that Lotus founder Mitchell D. Kapor,
who resigned as chairman in July 1986, breached a
confidentiality agreement with SAPC.  Kapor, also named as a
defendant, had worked for a firm that had marketing rights to
VisiCalc before founding Lotus.
    The suit alleges that Lotus and Kapor deliberately sought
to make 1-2-3 look and feel like VisiCalc by copying a number
of commands, keystrokes and screen displays.
    Lotus, in response, said it feels the suit is without merit.

<title>KUWAIT SAID SEEKING FOREIGN PROTECTION FOR OIL</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </dateline>Kuwait has asked at least four
countries, including the United States, Soviet Union, Britain
and China, for temporary use of their flags or tankers to
protect Kuwaiti oil shipments in the troubled Persian Gulf,
Reagan Administration officials said.
    The officials confirmed a New York Times report that Kuwait
wants to transfer some of its oil tankers to U.S. or Soviet
registration in hopes Iran would be reluctant to launch new
"Silkworm" missiles at superpower flags.
    The United States has vowed to keep the gulf open to
international oil traffic and has warned Tehran against using
the Chinese-made missiles recently installed in Iran near the
mouth of the gulf.
    "They (the Kuwaitis) have also asked Britain, China and
possibly some other European countries to lease tankers to
carry their oil," one of the administration officials, who asked
not to be identified, told Reuters.
    The United States is considering the request to temporarily
transfer Kuwaiti ships to American registration, but such a
move could create insurance and other problems, the officials
said.
    U.S. defense officials told Reuters yesterday that Kuwait
had decided for at least the time being not to accept a U.S.
offer to use American warships to escort its tankers in the
gulf, where both Iran and Iraq have been attacking shipping.

<title>HONG KONG FEBRUARY TRADE SWINGS INTO DEFICIT</title>
<dateline>    HONG KONG, March 26 - </dateline>Hong Kong recorded a 3.51 billion
H.K. Dlr deficit in February after a 2.54 billion dlr surplus
in January as imports climbed and exports slid, the Census and
Statistics Department said.
    The deficit compared with a deficit of 1.76 billion dlrs in
February 1986.
    Imports rose to 24.12 billion dlrs, up 2.6 pct from
January's 23.52 billion dlrs and 42 pct above the 16.98 billion
dlrs recorded in February 1986.
    Total exports for the month fell 20.9 pct to 20.61 billion
dlrs from 26.06 billion in January.
    February exports were still 35.4 pct above the 15.22
billion dlrs recorded in the same month last year.
    Re-exports, the territory's traditional entrepot trade,
outpaced domestically produced exports for the first time since
March 1985.
    Re-exports fell 11.6 pct to 10.62 billion dlrs from 12.0
billion dlrs in January but were 54 pct above February 1986's
6.88 billion dlrs. Domestic exports slid 28.9 pct to 9.99
billion dlrs from January's 14.05 billion dlrs but were up 19.7
pct over the 8.35 billion dlrs recorded in February 1986.

    Lange would not name the forecasting groups.

<title>JAPAN ADOPTS STOP-GAP BUDGET</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 27 - </dateline>The government adopted an 8,829 billion
yen stop-gap budget for fiscal 1987 starting April 1 to
compensate for the delay in the passage through the Parliament
of the full 1987/88 budget.
    The provisional budget includes 1,862 billion yen in public
works spending to help stimulate the economy and meet overseas
demand for Japan to import more and reduce its huge trade
surplus, officials said.
    They said the stop-gap budget will be in effect for 50 days
through May 20 and is the largest ever.
    The budget includes 1,580 billion yen in new government
bond issues.
    Officials said the spending on public works accounts for
about two-sevenths of the 6,017 billion yen in public works
outlay set aside in the pending formal 1987/88 budget.
    The planned full budget totals 54,101 billion yen.
    The government had to work out the stop-gap budget because
budget debates have been delayed by an opposition boycott of
Parliamentary business in protest against a planned five pct
sales tax.

<title>ECUADOR SEEKS HALT TO PAYMENTS TO BANKS IN 1987</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, March 11 - </dateline>Ecuador, stricken by a severe earthquake,
is seeking through negotiations with private foreign banks to
postpone all payments due to them for the rest of the year,
Finance Minister Domingo Cordovez said.
    He said in a statement, "The idea with the foreign banks is
to obtain from them the best terms to give the Ecuadorean
economy a complete relief in the period of deferral of payments
on the foreign debt during the present year."
    The statement referred only to payments due to private
foreign banks, a senior government finance official told
Reuters.
    These creditors hold two-thirds of Ecuador's foreign debt
which totals 8.16 billion dlrs.
    It did not refer to debts maturing to foreign governments
and multilateral lending agencies, accounting for the remainder
of Ecuador's foreign debt, the official said.
    He said Ecuador owed the private foreign banks between 450
and 500 mln dlrs in interest payments for the rest of 1987 and
about 66 mln in principal payments maturing this year.
    Cordovez said Ecuador would seek new loans from
multilateral organisations. A World Bank mission was due here
soon to evaluate emergency loans, government officials said.
    Ecuador has also appealed for emergency
aid from about 40 foreign governments.
    Government officials have calculated losses to the 1987
budget from last Thursday's earthquake at 926 mln dlrs.
    In 1986, Ecuador's total service on the foreign debt was
about 996 mln dlrs to all creditors.
    The quake ruptured Ecuador's main oil pipeline, suspending
crude exports for five months until the line is repaired. Oil
accounts for up to two-thirds of its total exports and up to 60
pct of total revenues. Before the tremor, Ecuador suspended
interest payments on January 31 to private foreign banks.
    Officials said they stopped interest payments due to a
cash-flow squeeze stemming from a slide in world oil prices,
which cut 1986 exports by about 25 pct to 2.18 billion dlrs.
    Ecuadorean finance officials have been in telephone contact
every day this week with some of the banks who sit on its
14-bank advisory committee, the senior government finance
official said. The committee represents the country's 400 or so
private foreign bank creditors.
    Cordovez also said in the statement, "The banks should
perceive that it is impossible at this moment to comply with
what was forseen."
    Cordovez added, Ecuador must make a new proposal in line
with the reality since the earthquake by seeking better options
of deferment and of softening the negotiation conditions."
    Interest payments fall due at least monthly to private
foreign banks.
    Ecuador's initial proposal earlier this year was to make
only one semi-annual or one annual interest payment this year.
    Under this proposal, it sought to defer interest payments
until June at the earliest, foreign bankers and government
officials here said.
    Ecuadorean officials held their last formal meeting with
the advisory committee in New York in January, but the
negotiations were suspended on January 16 due to the 12-hour
kidnapping of President Leon Febres Cordero by air force
paratroopers.
    The Red Cross says that least 300 people died and at least
4,000 are missing due to the earthquake.

<title>CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK LOWERING VISA RATES</title>
<dateline>    TORONTO, April 1 - </dateline><Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>
said it was lowering the interest rate on its Visa credit card
to 15.9 pct from 18.6 pct, effective with the May billing
statement.
    The bank said it was also halving its yearly Visa card user
fee to six dlrs, but would retain its 15 ct fee for each
transaction.
    A bank spokesman said the previously reported call by the
Canadian Parliament's finance committee on March 20 for a
substantial cut in credit card rates "was a factor" in the
move, but he would not elaborate.
    Canada's minister of state for finance Thomas Hockin had
threatened legislation to reduce the rates, which apply to
unpaid balances, if the financial institutions did not
voluntarily act.
    The Canadian Imperial Bank spokesman said "the bank card
market is a very competitive one and we have to move to stay
competitive."
    Canadian Imperial's new rates match those of <Toronto
Dominion Bank>, which lowered its rates before the finance
committee report.
    Canadian Imperial Bank added that cardholders will be
allowed to choose between the 15 ct transaction fee or the six
dlr yearly card fee.
    It will also eliminate the 50 ct minimum monthly
transaction fee, it said.
    Minister of State for Finance, Tom Hockin, said in the
House of Commons today he was "delighted" with the bank's cut
in its credit card rate.
    "I would hope retail stores and other financial
institutions will look to their rates as well," Hockin said
during the daily question period.

<title>YUGOSLAV WORKERS MAY BE ANGERED BY LOST SUBSIDIES</title>
<dateline>    BELGRADE, April 8 - </dateline>Yugoslav government plans to stop
subsidising loss-making firms will anger hundreds of thousands
of workers, Western diplomats said.
    The law, proposed by Prime Minister Branko Mikulic, goes
into effect on July 1 and aims to end a long-standing practice
of supporting unprofitable companies. Under the law, wage cuts
will be imposed on losing enterprises, while those failing to
recover within a six-month grace period will face liquidation.
    The diplomats said Mikulic's attempt to create a market
economy is inevitable, but has still come as a shock to those
accustomed to government subsidies.
    "It was a bitter pill which had to be swallowed, but if an
overdose is taken too abruptly, it may have adverse effects on
the system," a Western diplomat said.
    He said if the law was applied too strictly it would
probably provoke a new wave of strikes and unrest.
    Yugoslavia was swept by strikes last month following the
introduction of a wage-freeze law, later amended to allow more
flexibility and some exemptions in what some political analysts
saw as a retreat by Mikulic.
    But with inflation moving towards 100 pct, trade union
leaders have asked how much more deprivation workers can take.
    The union leaders said workers thoughout the country are
already receiving salaries below limits set under existing law,
while others have received no wages at all this year because
their employers are unable to pay them.
    Workers also complain much of their income is taken in
local, state and federal taxes.
    Many others are losing their motivation to work and
confidence in government as they feel their decision-making
powers are being eroded, trade union officials said.
    Meanwhile, the official Tanjug news agency reported a paper
and cellulose factory at Ivangrad in the Montenegro republic
closed yesterday and 2,000 of its workers were given "temporary
leave."
    Tanjug said the plant had been running at a loss for the 24
years it had been in operation, and its closure was the result
of "economic necessity" rather than bankruptcy.

<title>TURKEY SEEN UNLIKELY TO JOIN EC THIS CENTURY</title>
<dateline>    BRUSSELS, April 13 - </dateline>Turkey, which tomorrow will formally
apply to join the European Community, faces major obstacles in
its bid and is unlikely to become the bloc's 13th member before
the year 2000, EC officials said.
    Turkey's move comes as no surprise, but some officials said
the application from a relatively poor country with most of its
territory in Asia rather than Europe was likely to spark a long
process of soul-searching among the EC's current members about
what kind of European Community they wanted in the long term.
    Officials echoed the view of diplomats in Ankara that
Turkey's move put the EC in the dilemma of wanting to make
clear it values Ankara as an ally in the NATO alliance, but
sees huge problems in accepting it as a fellow EC member.
    They said industrialised Community members have tried to
dissuade Turkey from making the long-discussed formal
application until the EC had had more time to digest the
accession of Spain and Portugal last year.
    Several also feel Ankara and the EC should first fully
implement a 23-year-old association agreement between them
before Turkey becomes a full member.

<dateline>    THE HAGUE, April 9 - </dateline>The Netherlands' largest insurer
Nationale Nederlanden NV <NTTN.AS> (NatNed) said it expected at
least unchanged results in 1987 after reporting 1986 net
profits up 5.3 pct to 635.5 mln guilders from 603.4 mln in
1985,
    Revenues increased by 0.5 pct to 17.35 billion guilders
after 17.27 billion the previous year, and the dividend was
raised to 2.50 guilders per share from 2.38 guilders in 1985,
corrected on a capital increase.
    The company said guilder revenue and profit were pressured
by falls in exchange rates, particularly in the US and
Australian dollar and sterling.
    Without these currency fluctuations, net profit would have
been 30.7 mln guilders higher and revenue 1.97 billion higher,
NatNed said.
    The international share in turnover was 50 pct in 1986
compared with 52 pct in 1985.
    The company's life insurance result fell to 365.7 mln
guilders after 428.4 mln in 1985 due to currency influences,
tighter interest margins and increased investment.
    Claim payouts fell to 9.9 mln guilders after 66.6 mln the
previous year.
    The company's total assets reached 69.87 billion guilders
in 1986 against 67 billion the year before.
    Assets per share equalled 65.68 guilders against 65.53.

<title>ECUADOR SAYS IT WILL PAY DEBT WHEN IT CAN</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, March 16 - </dateline>President Leon Febres Cordero said
Ecuador would honour its debt when it had the capacity to make
payments, but said foreign banks had calculated oil would have
to be 25 dlrs a barrel for Ecuador to meet its commitments.
    Ecuador said on Friday that last week's earthquake was
forcing it to reaffirm an earlier decision -- based on the
slide in world oil prices -- to suspend debt payments to
private foreign banks, which hold two-thirds of its 8.16
billion dlr foreign debt.
    "All legitimate debt is a commitment of honour," the
president said during a visit to the quake zone. "A government
as a sovereign entity has dignity and prestige to maintain."
    Private foreign banks and the World Bank had calculated oil
would have to be at least 25 dlrs a barrel for Quito to be able
to meet its commitments, Febres Cordero said.
    He added that Ecuadorean crude was now selling for 15 to 17
dlrs a barrel after having been sold for many months at 12 dlrs
a barrel and as low as seven dlrs before that.
    Meanwhile, Ecuador announced an austerity program and a
price freeze on key consumer goods as a result of the
earthquake, which killed at least 300 people.
    Presidency Minister Patricio Quevedo said the budget would
be cut by five to 10 pct, government hiring would be frozen and
salaries of top officials, including the president and cabinet,
would be reduced.
    He also said a price freeze would be imposed on 20 basic
consumer items, mainly food staples, while the price of
gasoline would rise by between 69 and 80 pct and bus fares
would rise by 20 pct. Gasoline supplies would also be limited.

<title>ECUADOR ADOPTS AUSTERITY MEASURES AFTER QUAKE</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, March 7 - </dateline>OPEC member Ecuador adopted austerity
measures to conserve fuel after oil production was paralyzed by
a strong earthquake.
    Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa announced on
television the country would cut domestic fuel sales by 30 pct.
A ministry statement had earlier announced indefinite
suspension of crude oil exports, declaring force majeure.
    Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a
television interviewer that it could possibly take more than a
month to repair Ecuador's main pipeline linking Amazon basin
oil fields to the Pacific Ocean coast.
    The quake on Thursday, which registered six on the 12-point
Mercalli scale, killed at least six people and was centred near
the Reventador volcano about 90 km (50 miles) east of Quito.
    Ecuador had recently been pumping 260,000 barrels per day.
    The government's austerity measures ban the sale of
aviation fuel to foreign airliners on international routes and
no fuel will be available for ships owned by foreign lines.
    Ecuador also banned the sale of petrol on weekends and
holidays and limited sales on weekdays, an Energy and Mines
Ministry communique said.

<title>ECUADOR HAS TRADE SURPLUS IN FIRST FOUR MONTHS</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, June 18 - </dateline>Ecuador posted a trade surplus of 10.6 mln
dlrs in the first four months of 1987 compared with a surplus
of 271.7 mln in the same period in 1986, the central bank of
Ecuador said in its latest monthly report.
    Ecuador suspended sales of crude oil, its principal export
product, in March after an earthquake destroyed part of its
oil-producing infrastructure.
    Exports in the first four months of 1987 were around 639
mln dlrs and imports 628.3 mln, compared with 771 mln and 500
mln respectively in the same period last year.
    Exports of crude and products in the first four months were
around 256.1 mln dlrs, compared with 403.3 mln in the same
period in 1986. The central bank said that between January and
May Ecuador sold 16.1 mln barrels of crude and 2.3 mln barrels
of products, compared with 32 mln and 2.7 mln respectively in
the same period last year.
    Ecuador's international reserves at the end of May were
around 120.9 mln dlrs, compared with 118.6 mln at the end of
April and 141.3 mln at the end of May 1986, the central bank
said. gold reserves were 165.7 mln dlrs at the end of May
compared with 124.3 mln at the end of April.

<title>AUSTRALIAN BUSINESS URGED TO RESTRAIN PROFITS</title>
<dateline>    CANBERRA, March 13 - </dateline>Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke
called on businessmen to hold their salaries and profit margins
as part of his campaign for economic restraint.
    In a speech to the National Press Club, Hawke said business
"must not puncture the spirit of community restraint" evident in
low wage increases and suppressed consumer demand.
    Hawke said the Federal Government would coordinate with
State administrations to monitor prices and profit margins.
    "At a time when a concerted national effort to restrain
costs is required, profit margins should not be increased," he
said.
    Direct price control did not appeal to the government, but
it would act to ensure market forces operated fairly and
businesses were reminded of their obligations to Australia,
Hawke said.
    The government would demonstrate its commitment with
spending cuts in its May 14 economic statement, he said.
    It would also limit increases in government excises
normally indexed to inflation to about six pct, Hawke said.

<title>GTE <GTE> SELLS DEBENTURES YIELDING 8.737 PCT</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 19 - </dateline>GTE Corp is raising 250 mln dlrs
through an offering of debentures due 2017 yielding 8.737 pct,
said sole underwriter UBS Securities Inc.
    UBS, the U.S. unit of Union Bank of Switzerland, won the
issue in competitive bidding against syndicates led by such
major U.S. houses as First Boston and Morgan Stanley.
    UBS has become the second foreign firm to manage an issue
in the domestic debt market this year, following Daiwa
Securities America Inc. However, investment bankers noted that
UBS was the first foreigner to break into the U.S. market when
it won a competitive bidding in June 1986.
    An officer on UBS's corporate syndicate desk said the GTE
issue is the fourth that the securities firm has managed.
    UBS bid the GTE debentures at 97.0025 and set a coupon of
8-1/2 pct and reoffering price of 97.50 to yield 112 basis
points over the off-the-run 9-1/4 pct Treasury bonds of 2016.
    Non-refundable for 10 years, the issue is rated A-3 by
Moody's and A-minus by Standard and Poor's.
    GTE last tapped the debt market when it sold on November
20, 1986, 250 mln dlrs of same-maturity, same-rated debt priced
to yield 9.388 pct, or 174 basis points over comparable
Treasury paper, underwriters noted.
    Underwriters said that two of the UBS-lead offerings were

bidding acting as sole underwriter.
    Daiwa, the U.S. unit of Daiwa Securities Co Ltd of Japan,

<title>SHOWBOAT <SBO> TO TAKE CHARGE, SEES 3RD QTR LOSS</title>
<dateline>    ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., April 8 - </dateline>Showboat Inc will take a
charge of 19 to 20 mln dlrs pretax against results for the
third quarter ended March 31, director and assistant to the
president J. Kell Houssels III told Reuters.
    He said the charge results from pre-operating expenses of
its recently-opened Atlantic City, N.J., Showboat Hotel, Casino
and Bowling Center and will cause a loss for the third quarter
and probably for all of fiscal 1987 as well.
    But Houssels said Showboat's earnings for fiscal 1988
should show a sharp increase from fiscal 1986 levels due to the
contribution of the new Atlantic City facility.
    Showboat earned 1,753,000 dlrs in last year's third
quarter.  For all of fiscal 1986 it earned 5,769,000 dlrs.
    Houssels said Showboat since the opening of the Atlantic
City hotel/casino, Showboat has had to start charging interest
expenses connected with debt it sold to finance the facility
directly against income rather than capitalizing the interest
as it had been able to do previously.
    Showboat opened the hotel during its third quarter and
gaming began last Thursday on a regular basis after test gaming
was completed earlier in the week.

<dateline>    FORT SMITH, Ark., Oct 20 - </dateline>Sphinx Mining Inc said leased
mining claims in Alaska could produce revenues between 322 mln
dlrs and 966 mln dlrs from gold reserves.
    The range of the value of the reserves is attributed to the
wide range of grade estimates of the ore, the company said.
    A 1984 feasibility study put the grade at 0.008 ounces per
cubic yard, while subsequent exploration work proved that areas
of higher-grade gravel of up to 0.027 ounces/yard do exist,
Sphinx said.
    The claims are located 80 miles northwest of Fairbanks.

<title>JAPAN AUCTIONS 1,000 BILLION YEN SHORT-TERM PAPER</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 10 - </dateline>Japan's Finance Ministry auctioned 1,000
billion yen worth of tankoku, six month debt-financing paper,
to roll over previously issued tankoku maturing on March 19, a
spokesman said.
    The last tankoku auction, on February 12, produced a record
low yield of 3.383 pct, reflecting expectation of a half point
cut in Japan's discount rate, he said.
    In the previous auction for 1,000 billion yen, four major
Japanese securities houses took 92 pct of the issue amount in
an attempt to meet strong demand from large institutional
investors, securities managers said.
    Securities managers said they expect the auction to go well
again this time as securities houses will try to expand their
inventories of tankoku on continuing good response from
institutional investors.
    Contrary to a projected low yield on tankoku, short-term
interest rates have been resisting a fall on growing demand for
funds ahead of the March 31 financial year-end, they said.
    The Bank of Japan has been trying to dampen money market
rates to make the latest discount rate cut effective, but so
far in vain, dealers said.
    The auction results will be announced tomorrow.

<title>U.S. MARCH JOBLESS RATE FELL TO 6.6 PCT</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 3 - </dateline>The U.S. civilian unemployment rate
fell to 6.6 pct in March from 6.7 pct in February, the Labor
Department said.
    The number of non-farm payroll jobs rose 164,000 last month
after rising a revised 236,000 in February. That was down from
the previously reported 337,000 rise in February.
    The March unemployment rate was the lowest since March,
1980. It had remained unchanged at 6.7 pct for three straight
months before the March decline.
    The rise in non-farm payrolls was the smallest since a
decline last June of 75,000, the department said.
    Last month's unemployment rate was down from the 7.2 pct
level in March, 1986.
    Growth in jobs continued in March but was slower than in
recent months, with the gains concentrated in service
industries.
    The number of goods-producing jobs fell 68,000 in March,
while service-producing jobs rose 232,000 to bring the total
jobs in the department's survey of businesses to 102.03 mln in
March.
    Business and health services showed the largest gains in
jobs, while manufacturing employment fell by 25,000.
    The average work week fell to 34.8 hours in March from 35.0
hours in February, the department said.
    Manufacturing hours fell to 40.9 per week from 41.2 hours
in February, but overtime hours increased to 3.7 from 3.6.
    The department's survey of households showed the number of
unemployed stood at 7.85 mln out of a work force of 119.2 mln.
    The number of persons working part time for economic
reasons fell in March to 5.46 mln from 5.78 mln in February.
    The loss of factory jobs brought the March total to 19.19
mln jobs and was concentrated in automobile, electrical and
electronic manufacturing.
    Construction employment also lowered the number of jobs in
the goods-producing sector, falling by 45,000 after seasonal
adjustment, the department said.
    Mining employment was little changed in March and has not
experienced any substantial erosion since the rapid job losses
in oil and gas drilling in the first two-thirds of 1986.
    Other service industries that increased jobs last month
were finance, insurance, and real estate.

<title>NIGERIA REVERSES POLICY, RESTORES MINIMUM WAGE</title>
<dateline>    LAGOS, April 24 - </dateline>Nigeria's military government retreated
in the face of hostile public opinion and restored the minimum
wage of 125 naira (about 32 dlrs) a month.
    It revoked an order made only last December which exempted
companies with fewer than 500 employees -- the vast majority --
from paying the minimum wage.
    Labour Minister Brigadier Ike Nwachukwu, announcing the
decision in Lagos today, said it was made out of respect for
public opinion and to maintain industrial harmony.
    Nwachukwu said the thinking behind the exemption was in
line with Nigeria's far-reaching structural adjustment program
and the measure was intended to promote small-scale industry
and agriculture.

<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 24 - </dateline>A member of the Federal Reserve
Board, Robert Heller, said he wanted to see stronger Japanese
demand for American goods.
    "What I was advocating here was more Japanese purchases of
American goods," Heller said in response to a question about the
dollar's weakness in currency markets.
    He told a Heritage Foundation forum, "I'd be very happy to
see that."
    In his formal remarks, Heller said he supported the idea of
using commodity prices as an indicator for monetary policy.
    Asked if he would raise the issue at the next Federal Open
Market Committee meeting, he said, "Even at previous meetings
commodity prices were raised."
    He added, "I would not expect future meetings to be
different from past meetings in that respect."

<dateline>    TOKYO, March 26 - </dateline>Mazda Motor Corp <MAZT.T> has no plans to

posted county prices for corn.
    "We do not relate the Texas Gulf structure with the

    Rumors had circulated through the market this morning that
USDA had widened Texas Gulf differentials in a similar manner
to last weekend's adjustments with the Louisiana Gulf.

<title>TALKING POINT/VIACOM INTERNATIONAL <VIA></title>
<author>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </dateline>A bidding war for Viacom International
Inc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted a
management group and other investors against National
Amusements Inc, a closely held theater operator.
    Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source
close to the management side insisted that timing was on his
side. He said if outside directors approve the management
proposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders
with proxy material going out late this week. "It would take 20
days from the day we mail," said the source.
    The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by
investor Sumner Redstone, would need "half a year" to complete
a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must
accompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licenses
and cable television franchises.
    Redstone was not available for comment.
    Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a rare
situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One
said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and
if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to
the Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win.
    The independent directors of Viacom were called into a
meeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.
    Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One
major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. "We think
we're at the end now, in terms of bidding," said the firm's
arbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified.
    Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal would
create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The
management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5
billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred
stock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.
    Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash,
a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a
value of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock
stock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity
interest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated
the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the
total package worth 52 dlrs per share.
    Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable
preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of
convertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion
was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.
    Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he
would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond
April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The
plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct
during May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered
eight pct interest.
    Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management
group, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes,
were offering high prices. "Redstone really wants to own the
company," one said. Another said management seemed to have the
edge on the timing issue.
    Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares.
    A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what
the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He
noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp <FMC>, which
adopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally
traded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now
just over 30 dlrs.
    Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two
two cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs
from several acquisitions affected results.
    Shares of Warner Communications Inc <WCI> rose 7/8 to
31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25
mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at
37.50 dlrs.
    Chris Craft Industries <CCN>, which owns a stake in Warner,
rose 1-1/4 to 22-3/4.
    Viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from CBS Inc <CBS>.
The company has 940,000 cable television subscribers, operates
nine satellite television services and owns television and
radio stations. It is one of the largest distributors of films
and other programs for television.

<title>CONCERN OVER "EL NINO" IN PERU - USDA REPORT</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 20 - </dateline>There are heightened fears that "El
Nino" may be returning to Peru with an intensity approaching the
1983 disaster, which affected the weather on several continents
and caused widespread damage through floods and drought, the
U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Lima said in a field
report.
    Continued heavy rains in the northern coastal area,
flooding of several major rivers and mud slides have led to
increased concern, the report, dated March 17, said.
    However, it said official sources still believe that this
year's El Nino will have only weak to moderate intensity.
    EL Nino is a phenomenon involving a shift in winds and
waters in the pacific.
    The USDA report said that so far the El Nino now being
experienced has not had an overall negative impact on
agricultural production.
    Excessive rains in the Piura Pima cotton area may reduce
yields by about 20 pct due to excessive growth too early in the
crop cycle.
    Also insect damage to crops could be more extensive where
excessive moisture exists, it said.
    However, the El Nino has resulted in a much improved supply
of irrigation water in the major dams which will improve
prospects for many crucial crops such as rice and corn, and
slow the decline in sugar production, it said.
    If El Nino picks up momentum, Peru's fishing industry could
receive a setback. But trade sources still believe the fish
catch for industrial processing will reach 5.5 mln tonnes in
1987, almost 20 pct above last year, the report said.
    Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are three
to four degrees centigrade above normal but still not high
enough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters, it said.
    It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino will
intensify and carry on through late March, April and May
causing problems as crops approach harvest.
    "There appears to be no way to project the course of El Nino
-- only time will tell," the report said.

<dateline>    TOKYO, March 27 - </dateline>The Bank of Japan intervened in the
market to keep the dollar above 149 yen but the unit was under
strong selling pressure by an investment trust, dealers said.
    The central bank stepped into the market when the dollar
fell towards 149.00 yen, but a trust bank aggressively sold
dollars to hedge currency risks, and the Bank intervened again
at 149.00, they said.
    The trust bank apparently changed its earlier view that the
dollar would rise and started selling relatively large amounts
of dollars, pushing the unit down to 148.80 at one point,
brokers said.
    One dealer estimated that the Bank bought 400 mln to 500
mln dlrs as it tried to keep the U.S. Currency above 149 yen.

<title>FEBRUARY U.S. RETAIL SALES NOT SIGN OF UPTURN</title>
<author>     BY SUSAN ZEIDLER, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 5 - </dateline>U.S. retailers posted stronger than
expected sales in February, but not enough to prompt analysts
to change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for the
first half of 1987.
     "My feeling is that it (February) borrowed some of the
business we normally see later in the quarter and the real
strength of general merchandise sales will be in the second
half of 1987," said Bear Stearns and Co analyst Monroe
Greenstein.
    "I don't think March will be as strong because Easter falls
in April this year," said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb.
   Analysts generally average the sales results of March and
April to account for the variation of Easter's occurrence.
    Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said
sales for February rose between six and 6.5 pct, compared to a
3.6 pct increase last year.
     Analysts noted that February is considered a small,
transitory month between winter and spring.
    In addition, sales comparisons were boosted by an
especially soft February last year which was adversely affected
by severe weather.
    Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales,
according to retailers and analysts.
    "February's strong sales reflected a lot of fresh
merchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due to
tax reductions," said Greenstein of Bear Stearns.
    Analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales of
durable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuing
high levels of consumer debt.
     May Department Stores Co <MAY> and K Mart Corp <KM> were
among the strong performers, posting comparable store sales
gains of 9.4 pct and 8.2 pct, respectively. May had an overall
sales gain of 15.0 pct and K Mart had a 13.1 pct sales gain 
last month.
    "Favorable consumer response to our merchandise programs
continued to positively impact our sales comparisons. IN
addition to the strong contribution by K Mart stores, all our
specialty retailing companies had excellent February sales,"
said K Mart chairman Bernard Fauber.
    Sears Roebuck and Co <S> posted a 4.9 pct increase.
"Domestic sales were led by better than average increases in
apparel, home fashions and hardware and especially strong
catalog sales," said Sears chairman Edward Brennan.
    Analysts were a little disappointed by J.C. Penney Co Inc
<JCP> which started out with especially strong sales early in
the month. Penney posted a 5.5 pct increase on a comparitive
store basis and a 5.3 pct gain in overall sales.
    Penney chairman William Howell said, "store sales were
strongest during the early part of the month, while catalog
demand was consistently strong throughout the period.
    Store sales activity varied throughout the country, ranging
from good in the East to weak in the depressed southwest.
    Analysts also said gross profit margins were high as
retailers were not overly promotional due to leaner inventories
than a year ago.
    "February is not a big month seasonally but these numbers
suggest a fairly good trend for consumer spending," said Drexel
Burnham Lambert analyst Jeff Edelman.

<title>ECUADOR SUSPENDS PAYMENTS TO PRIVATE BANKS</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, March 13 - </dateline>Ecuadorean President Leon Febres Cordero
said his country was unilaterally suspending payments to
private foreign banks due to last week's earthquake which
caused up to one billion dollars in damage.
    Febres Cordero, quoted in an Information Ministry
communique, said: "We have to ratify this suspension ... on debt
service to the private international banks.
    "I am not ashamed to say it, there definitely isn't a way to
pay," he said.
    Ecuador had already suspended payments to private foreign
banks, holding two-thirds of Ecuador's 8.16 billion dollar
foreign debt, from last January due to a cash-flow squeeze
stemming from a slide in world oil prices last year.
    But finance officials had earlier said the length of the
suspension would depend on negotiations with private foreign
banks.
    The information ministry communique said febres cordero
made these statments to reporters at lago agrio, at the heart
of ecuador's region of jungle oilfields, before returning to
quito.
    Febres cordero said up to a total of 1,000 people died or
were missing in avalanches and mudslides during the march 5
earthquake.
    The tremor damaged an oil pipeline, thus barring all crude
exports for a projected five months. Oil accounts for up to
two-thrids of ecuador's total exoprts and for as much as 60 per
cent of the government's revenues.
    He did not specify for how long the suspension of payments
would last.
    Ecuador owes private foreign banks 450 to 500 mln dlrs in
interest payments for the rest of the year and 66 mln dlrs
in principal payments maturing in 1987, finance officials said.
    Finance minister domingo cordovez said two days ago the
government seeks to postpone all the payments due to private
foreign banks in 1987 until next year through negotiations with
these creditors.

<title>TALKING POINT/EASTERN AIRLINES <TEX></title>
<author>    By Matt Spetalnick, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    Miami, March 16 - </dateline>A rash of firings, fears of mass layoffs
and management overtures for wage concessions have set the
stage for all-out war between Eastern Airlines and its unions,
analysts and labor leaders say.
    The bitter labor-management dispute has hurt efforts to
revive the ailing carrier and could ultimately lead Texas Air,
Eastern's new owner, to tranfer scores of Eastern jets to its
non-union sister airlines, analysts said.
    "It's a trump card that Texas Air could resort to if things
get bad enough -- repainting Eastern planes and shifting them
over Continental Airlines," said Louis Marckesano, an analyst
for Janney Montgomery Scott Inc of Philadelphia.
    Eastern lost 130.8 mln dlrs in 1986, and analysts see
little chance of the carrier returning to profitability this
year.
    Since the Miami-based carrier was taken over by Texas Air
last year, the morale of Eastern's 38,000 employees has
plummeted, workers and labor leaders say.
    Some Eastern officials acknowledge privately that morale
problems have contributed to high absenteeism and a decline in
customer service, triggering a barrage of passenger complaints.
    Union leaders are accusing Eastern's managers -- many of
them newly installed by Texas Air chairman Frank Lorenzo -- of
conducting a campaign of harassment and intimidation aimed at
ridding the airline of high-paid, senior employees.
    "It's an underhanded way of forcing experienced people out
in an attempt to cut the company's labor costs," said Nancy
Tauss, vice president of the Transport Workers Union Local 553.
    Some flight attendants complain that they are being stalked
by what they call "spyriders" -- teams of auditors they say
have been hired by Lorenzo to fly on Eastern jets and secretly
examine flight crew performance.
    Since the beginning of the year, at least a dozen flight
attendants have been fired as a result of such audits, some for
having as little as two dlrs missing from liquor sales and
movie headset rentals, Tauss said.
    Eastern officials acknowledge that management is tightening
its accounting procedures and cracking down on absenteeism,
which the airline says cost 70 mln dlrs last year -- the 
highest in the industry.
    But Eastern spokeman Jim Ashlock denied that the Miami-base
airline was using unfair labor tactics. "We're just trying to
correct long-standing problems and that causes some
dissatisfaction," he said.
    U.S. Rep. Newt Gingrich, a Georgia Republican, has met with
groups of dissident Eastern employees in Atlanta and is
reported to have told them he may call for hearings on the
airline's labor tactics.
    Labor and management have a long history of bitter
relations at Eastern Airlines.
    But the conflict has escalated sharply since January 21,
when Eastern president Philip Bakes called for a reduction of
490 mln dlrs, or 29 pct, in annual labor costs, mostly through
union concessions.
    Eastern's three principal unions have rejected demands for
wage cuts and have refused to open their contracts for
renegotiation.
    Union officials say that in retaliation for their
resistance, the airline has launched a "firing frenzy" aimed at
intimidating employees and squeezing concessions from labor.
    During 1986 -- the year in which Texas Air managers assumed
control of Eastern -- 123 flight attendants were fired.  That
was nearly five times greater than 1985, the union said. In the
first two months of this year 35 flight attendants losing their
jobs, according to union records.
    Other unions report similar losses.
    Texas Air last month said it would switch six of Eastern's
wide-body jets to Continental, its cut-rate sister airline.
    Eastern has begun hiring other Texas Air carriers to repair
its planes in several cities and plans to shut down some
maintenance bases, according to a recent internal memo.
    "Texas Air is not going to write checks to Eastern to
underwrite an outmoded labor cost structure," Bakes told a
meeting of Miami businessmen this month. He denied, however,
that Lorenzo planned to strip Eastern of its assets.

<title>U.S. AID CHIEF TO BE NAMED TO TOP TREASURY POST</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 7 - </dateline>President Reagan will shortly
nominate the head of the U.S. program for Third World
development, Peter McPherson, as second-ranking officer of the
Department of the Treasury, administration sources said.
    They said the White House was expected to announce
McPherson's nomination to succeed Richard Darman as deputy
Treasury scretary later this week.
    The nomination is subject to Senate approval.
    McPherson has headed the Agency for International
Development (AID) since 1981. As Treasury Secretary James
Baker's chief assistant, he would be expected to work closely
on international economic policy, including the major problems
of the Mexican and Brazilian debts.
    McPherson, a lawyer, worked in the White House under
President Gerald Ford, after serving as a corporate tax
specialist for the Internal Revenue Service.
    He also spent two years in Peru as a member of the Peace
Corps.
    Darman, who was considered to have played a central role in
achieving agreements among industrial countries on
international economic policy, will leave the Treasury on April
13 to join the Investment Banking Group of Shearson Lehman
Brothers.

<title>GENENTECH <GENE> SETBACK VIEWED AS TEMPORARY</title>
<author>    By Samuel Fromartz, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 1 - </dateline>Genentech Inc is suffering only a
temporary setback following a U.S. agency decision to withhold
a recommendation on its genetically-produced drug which is used
to treat heart attacks in progress, industry sources and
analysts said.
    "When TPA (the drug) first came on the scene, the projected
time scale for approval was 1990," said Sam Milstein, a
scientist and industry consultant.
    "So even with the new delay that has arisen, in all
likelihood the drug will be approved prior to initial
projections," he added.
    Last Friday, an advisory committee at the Food and Drug
Administration, FDA, withheld a recommendation on Genentech's
tissue plasminogen activator, a drug called Activase.
    Athough it supported Genentech's claim that the drug
dissolves blood clots, the FDA said it wanted data that showed
the treatment benefits heart-attack victims.
    "We will be talking to the FDA as soon as possible to ask
specifically what they are looking for," a Genentech
spokeswoman said. She said the company had data that showed
improvement in the heart muscle after the drug was administered
but had not included it in the FDA filing.
 
    Industry analysts also said the 12 point drop in the
company's stock to 37-1/4 was largely expected in light of the
speculative nature of the biotechnology companies whose
fortunes often depend on the success of an important drug.
    "In larger pharmaceutical companies each product does not
have as much overall significance. But this is very important
to Genentech," said Robert Riley, a senior consultant at Arthur
D. Little Inc.
    Some estimated that Genentech could see as much as 1.5
billion dlrs from the drug. But with each delay, others can
enter the market and catch up to Genentech's lead.

    Industry sources pointed out that KabiVitrum, in an
alliance with Hoechst AG <HFAG.F>, won a recommendation for its
streptokinase drug on the same day Genentech's application was
delayed. Streptokinase, an enzyme-based drug, is also used to
treat heart attack victims.
    In addition, Milstein said that Beecham Group Plc <BHAM.L>
has a drug called Eminase which is "the most likely competitor
to TPA," and from a clinical standpoint, nearly identical.
Beecham's drug has been approved for use in Germany and is
awaiting approval in the U.K., he added.
     Streptokinase was difficult to administer to heart attack
victims because it would dissolve before it reached the heart.
Another method, which involved pumping the drug directly into
the heart through a tube, proved difficult when a heart attack
was in progress. TPA was seen as a savior since it was easier
to administer and worked quickly.
    But new developments have made streptokinase more effective
and easier to administer, becoming a potential threat to
Genentech's grasp on the TPA market. And if that wasn't enough,
about 30 other biotech companies are quickly developing TPA in
Genentech's path.
 
    "Genentech's advantage is being first in the market," said
industry consultant Scott King, formerly an analyst with
Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. "They'll be the first
approved but then they'll face competition after one or two
years."
    The company may also face patent pressures for its drug. It
is currently about to go to court with Beecham Group in the
U.K. in a patent dispute. And while its patent is pending in
the U.S., many analysts expect the company to face some suits
as soon as the patent is issued, a potentially more harmful
situation than any temporary setback in the FDA.

<title>NIPPON LIFE, SHEARSON TIE-UP SEEN SETTING TREND</title>
<author>    By Steven Brull, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 24 - </dateline>Nippon Life Insurance Co's 538 mln dlr
purchase of a 13 pct stake in Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc
brokerage unit is a shrewd move that other Japanese insurers
are likely to follow, securities analysts said.
    The investment in one of Wall Street's top brokerage houses
is likely to pay off in dollars and international market
position, they said. "It's part of a trend towards growing
capital participation by Japanese insurance firms in foreign
financial institutions," said Simon Smithson, an analyst with
Kleinwort Benson International Inc in Tokyo.
    The investment in Shearson Lehman, a growing firm described
by some analysts as the top U.S. Retail brokerage, will give
Nippon Life a ringside seat and possibly lower commissions on
Wall Street, where it invests an increasing percentage of its
assets of 90.2 billion dlrs, they said.
    Nippon Life staff will also acquire expertise in business
sectors which have not yet opened up in Japan, they added.
    The agreement between the two companies calls for a 50-50
joint venture in London focussing on investment advisory asset
management, market research, and consulting on financing.
    Nippon Life is Japan's largest insurance company and the
world's biggest institutional investor, analysts said.
    The Japanese finance ministry is expected to approve the
deal in April, making Nippon Life the first Japanese life
insurance firm to take a stake in a U.S. Financial firm.
    The limit on foreign assets as a proportion of Japanese
insurers' assets was increased to 25 pct from 10 pct last year.
Since then, they have stepped up purchases of foreign stocks
and sought to deepen their understandng of foreign markets and
instruments.
    Last year, a Sumitomo Life Insurance Co official was
appointed to E.F. Hutton Group Inc unit E.F. Hutton and Co's
board and Sumitomo Bank Ltd spent 500 mln dlrs to become a
limited partner in Goldman, Sachs and Co.
    Smithson said Japanese banks started buying smaller and
problem-plagued banks in 1984. "But now Japanese are going for
blue-chip organisations," he said.
    "It's a reflection of what has happened in manufacturing
industries," said Brian Waterhouse at James Capel and Co. "With a
historically high yen, and historically low interest rates,
there's an increasing disincentive to invest in Japan."
    Competition in fund management has grown along with greater
Japanese savings. The typical salaried employee has 7.33 mln
yen in savings, reflecting an annual average savings rate of 17
to 18 pct, he said.
    To stay competitive, fund managers must invest overseas and
gain experience with financial instruments which are likely to
spread to Japan with further deregulation. "The high regulatory
environment has delayed (life insurance firms')
diversification. Now there's a growing number of new products
in an environment of increasing competition for performance on
fund management," Smithson said.

base 1981, rose 14.21 pct to 162.19 in March from a revised
142.01 in February, and 7.19 pct from March 1986, the Economic
Ministry said.
    The February figure was revised from a preliminary 140.06.
    A ministry official said the March index stood at its
highest level since the 169.94 set in December 1986.
    He attributed the increase to rising production of
textiles, wooden and bamboo products, plastics, machinery,
electronics, transportation equipment, mining and house
construction.

<dateline>    BRUSSELS, June 18 - </dateline>Sweden's Sandvik AB <SVIK.ST> and
Diamant Boart SA of Belgium, in which Societe Generale de
Belgique <BELB.BR> holds an indirect 52 pct stake, have
finalised negotiations on merging oil and gas drilling tool
activities, officials of both companies said.
    Staffan Paues, President of the new Brussels-based joint
venture company Diamant Boart Stratabit SA (DBS), told a news
conference that the merged firm would be able to offer products
for all types of drilling operations.
    He said there were already signs that a slow recovery from
recession was under way in the oil and gas industries.
    "Stability in oil prices should lead to renewed investment"
Paues said.
    DBS, which Paues said began operations today, brings
together Sandvik's wholly-owned U.S. Subsidiary Strata Bit Corp
of Houston and Diamant Boart's petroleum activities in Europe,
North America, the Middle and Far East and Africa.
    Paues said the merger was a direct result of the sharp fall
in oil prices 18 months ago which led oil firms to cut back
exploration activities. Officials said the complementary
character of the two firms' operations was a further reason.

<title>CANADA GDP UP 0.1 PCT IN JANUARY</title>
<dateline>    OTTAWA, March 30 - </dateline>Canada's gross domestic product rose 0.1
pct, seasonally adjusted, in January after gaining 1.0 pct in
December but falling 0.1 pct and 0.3 pct in November and
October, Statistics Canada said.
    January's rise, in 1981 prices, was fueled largely by a 0.5
pct gain in the goods producing sector. Output in
services-producing industries declined 0.1 pct from December's
level.
    January's level was 1.29 pct higher than the same month a
year ago.
    The federal agency said it was the second straight gain for
goods producing industries. Most of the growth occurred in
manufacturing and construction.
    Within manufacturing, strong gains were posted in the wood,
machinery, non-metallic mineral and food product groups.
Significant declines were recorded in the output of automobiles
and parts, however.
    In the services sector, increases in finance, insurance and
communication were more than offset by declines in
transportation, storage and the retail trade.

early as today. But one banking source, though confirming that
most of the details had been worked out, said the chances of an
announcement today were about nil. He had no price details.
    The 10 mln shares on offer are expected to bring a cash
call in Germany for well over two billion marks. The share was
around 253 marks today after a 6.50 drop to 252 yesterday.

<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 1 - </dateline>President Reagan said he will use the
annual economic summit of major industrialized countries to
press for economic expansion by West Germany and Japan.
    In a pre-summit speech at the White House, Reagan said that
preserving a growing world economy was the business of every
member of the world trading community.
    "It will be made clear, especially to our friends in Japan
and the Federal Republic of Germany that growth-oriented
domestic policies are needed to bloster the world trading
system on which they depend," he said.

shortcovering demand at the Colombo rubber auction, brokers
said.
    One-X brown was traded at 19.75 rupees per kg, up 15 cents
from last rates while other grades also showed improvements.
The rise was attributed to a shortage of rubber available to
manufacture this type.
    Latex crepe prices were unchanged with the best one-X
selling at 20.92 rupees. Crepe one was traded at 20.68 and
crepe two at 20.45 rupees.
    Sheet was firm as in previous weeks with RSS1 averaging
22.05 rupees against 22 previously. The total quantity of
rubber offered at the sale was 320 tonnes.

<title>LAWSON WANTS STERLING AROUND 1.60 DLRS, 2.90 MKS</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, April 1 - </dateline>U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel
Lawson said he wanted sterling to stay roughly where it was,
specifying a rate of around 2.90 marks and 1.60 dlrs.
    He told the National Economic Development Council that the
recent Paris meeting of major industrialised nations had agreed
on the need for exchange rate stability. There was now a
"reasonable alignment of currencies" and the U.K. Government
intended to keep sterling at about its present level, he said.
    That meant around 2.90 marks, which is the single most
important rate to concentrate on, and 1.60 dlrs, Lawson said.
    His disclosure of two of the key targets for sterling was
highly unusual, foreign exchange market analysts said.
    In the past he has preferred to be less definite about the
Government's exchange rate policy, lest it give foreign
exchange markets set limits to test.
    Lawson told the committee, which is a tripartite forum of
government, unions and industry, that the pound would be kept
near its present level by a mixture of interest rates and
intervention in the foreign exchange markets.
    The pound finished trading here today at 1.6040/50 dlrs and
2.9210/45 marks.

year, Chairman Paul Oreffice said.
    "I'm hoping we will have the best year in our history

    "I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a
record year, or close to it," Oreffice said.
    In 1986, Dow earned 741 mln dlrs an increase from 1985's 58
mln dlrs brought about by falling oil prices and resulting
cheaper feedstock costs.
    Oreffice also said Dow's profit margins on chemical
products would improve this year over last year.
    He said reduced capacity in the chemical industry and the
weakened U.S. dollar would also contribute to the company's
improved performance.
    Dow will spending about 650 mln dlrs on research and
development in 1987 with an emphasis on new specialty
chemicals, Oreffice said.

<title>JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S.</title>
<author>    By Fumiko Fujisaki, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 8 - </dateline>Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered by
U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will
tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that
liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan,
a senior ministry official said.
    "Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives
by other suppliers," the official, who declined to be named,
said. "Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and
it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise
its farm import market," he said.
    Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.
Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open
its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to
protect local farmers.
    Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat
exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said.
End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.
    U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to
visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask
Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and
remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.
    Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market
share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has
been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year
beef accord next March 31.
    Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales
from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports
from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although
the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.
    U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its
beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain
imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.
    An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when
Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has
the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.
Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing
some one billion dlrs in new business.
    The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import
controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices,
purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts,
prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.
    To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's
top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove
residual import restrictions on agricultural products.
    But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional
reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue
should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the
industrial sector.
    "Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these
issues should not be discussed on the same table," the official
said.

<title>INDIA EXPORTS ITS FIRST PASSENGER CARS</title>
<dateline>    NEW DELHI, March 31 - </dateline>India today signed an agreement to
sell 500 mini passenger cars to Hungary, its first export
contract for cars, an industry ministry spokesman told Reuters.
    Under the agreement signed between Maruti Udyog Ltd (MUL) -
an Indo-Japanese car maker - and Hungary's state-owned Mogurt
trading company - the cars, valued about two mln dlrs, will be
delivered in 1987, he said.
    "We expect Hungary will buy up to 5,000 Maruti cars per year
from next year if the first batch proves popular in that
country," he said without elaborating.
    The launching of 800 cc Maruti cars in 1983 revolutionised
the country's dormant automobile industry, which until then had
marketed models which were at least 30 years old.
    The Indian government owns 74 pct stake in MUL, and the
balance of 26 pct is held by Suzuki Motor Co Ltd of Japan.
    The Japanese-style Maruti, costing about 81,000 rupees, is
the cheapest car on the Indian market and has proved a popular
model, with order books full for the next three years, industry
sources said.
    MUL and India's three private companies have a combined
production capacity of 206,000 passenger cars a year.

    The loan, which the IMF provides countries under special
circumstances, is equal to 25 pct of Ecuador's quota, or
economic standing, in the Fund.
    The IMF said that according to recent estimates, the
earthquakes will hurt the country's balance of payments this
year because of the loss of oil revenues due to destruction of
part of the oil pipeline.

<title>ECUADOR QUAKE TO CUT OIL REVENUES 800 MLN DLRS</title>
<dateline>    Quito, march 9 - </dateline>up to 300 people were feared dead and more
than 15,000 people left homeless by thursday's earthquake,
which will cost Ecuador close to 800 mln dlrs in lost petroleum
revenues, authorities said.
    They estimated the cost of repairing a damaged oil pipeline
at 150 mln dlrs.
    "the magnitude of the damages caused by the earthquake is
gigantic," president leon febres cordero said after inspecting
the damages in napo, the hardest-hit jungle province, 100 miles
from here.
    The quake damaged 40 km of an oil pipeline, forcing this
opec nation to suspend crude exports for four months, president
febres cordero said in a statement issued today by the
presidential press office.
    The country would lose an estimated 800 mln dlrs in crude
exports until the pipeline was repaired, the president said. It
would cost 150 mln dlrs to repair the pipelline which carries
oil from jungle oil fields over the andes to Balao, a pacific
ocean port.
    Crude traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of
ecuador's exports.
    the quake triggered landslides, swelling the aguarico river
which burst it banks carrying away homes and huts in napo
province, health minister jorge brancho told reuters.
    "we fear that up to 300 people died in napo though there is
no way of now knowing the exact figure because many people have
disappeared," he said.
    Other estimates ranged as high as 500 dead.
    So far 20 corpses have been recovered, bracho said.
    Information Minister Marco Lara told reporters: "the number
of dead and injured is not known ... because we do not know how
many people lived in the homes hit by the landslides."
    Bracho said at least 15,000 were left homeless in the
cayambe district.

said it expects first quarter earnings to be higher than the
year-ago 4,800,840 dlrs or 1.25 dlrs per share due to excellent
lawn and garden shipments.
    The company said bicycle sales were soft early in the
period, but recent orders and shipments have been running well
ahead of last year.
    It said it expects to meet analysts' projections of
earnings for the full year of 1.50 dlrs per share and it could
possibly exceed the estimate if orders continue strong.

<title>DREXEL TELLS U.S. STOCK BUYERS TO LOOK ABROAD</title>
<author>    By Cal Mankowski, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </dateline>Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc is telling
clients getting nervous about the volatile U.S. stock market to
take a look at European and other foreign stock markets.
    "We're still pushing for a fully invested position (in U.S.
stocks) but we also recognize the market is up 40 pct since
September," says Burton Siegel, investment strategist.
    Rein van der Does, director of international research,
admits to being cautious and somewhat confused about certain
developments in the Tokyo market, such as Nippon Telephone
shares trading at 250 times earnings.
    The firm recently dropped its recommendation on Jaguar plc
<JAGRY> following a sharp runup in the shares. About the same
time, says analyst Khaled Abdel Majeed, Drexel issued a buy
recommendation on the West german automaker BMW.
    He says a new plant and new models brighten the outlook for
1987 and 1988. "The company trades in Germany on the parent
company's earnings but on worldwide consolidated earnings, the
multiple is seven or eight, half that of competitors."
    By contrast Jaguar's share price to earnings multiple is
about 12 and Daimler-Benz AG is around 14 or 15.
    Drexel analyst Lucille Palermo recently upgraded
recommendations on some Canadian gold stocks. With no recession
in sight she sees improved physical demand plus new buying
interest from the Middle East. Also, expectation of a higher
inflation rate stimulates demand.
    On the supply side she thinks "people are overlooking the
problems in South Africa."  Palermo says all of this will push
the bullion price to 475 dlrs an ounce by the end of the year.
    Her current buy recommendations are Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd
<AEAGF>, American Barrick Resources Corp <ABX>, and Echo Bay
Mines Ltd <ECO>.
    Palermo also believes the overall Canadian stock market has
greater potential this year than last. Although the Canadian
dollar has moved up slightly it is below levels of several
years ago. "Canadian exports of all types look relatively cheap
to foreigners - resources, manufactured goods, bonds and
stocks."
    Other European stocks favored by Drexel include Club
Mediterranee <CMI>, Pernod-Ricard, Royal Dutch Petroleum <RD>,
Unilever <UN>, British Petroleum Co plc <BP> and Imperial
Chemical Industries plc <ICI>. Drexel cautions U.S. investors
that foreign dividends may be subject to withholding tax.

<title>WHITE HOUSE RAPS DEMOCRATS' BUDGET</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, June 18 - </dateline>The White House called a compromise
budget hammered out by congressional Democratic leaders a
"pickpocket" spending plan, but barred negotiations on changing
it until budget reforms are in place.
    Noting that the trillion dollar budget would raise taxes by
65 billion dlrs over the next three years while scaling back
President Reagan's military spending proposals, spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said, "The president isn't buying it and
neither will the American people.
    "The Democrats refer to tax increases as deficit reduction
-- a pickpocket way to lift your wallet to pay for your dinner,"
Fitzwater said.
    The White House official, in an apparent retreat from an
earlier administration stance, also said negotiations on a
budget acceptable to Reagan and the Democratic-led Congress
could not begin until budget reforms are adopted.
    The White House has previously said it would not negotiate
on a budget until the congressional Democrats were able to
agree among themselves. Democratic leaders have called for a
"summit" conference with the White House on the budget.
    "If we had a budget reform package that ensured a sound,
enforceable negotiating process, we would be interested in
pursuing it, Fitzwater said.

<title>UGANDA DISAPPOINTED BY COFFEE TALKS FAILURE</title>
<dateline>    KAMPALA, March 9 - </dateline>Uganda, Africa's second largest coffee
producer, was disappointed by the stalemate in recent coffee
talks in London, the chairman of the state-run Coffee Marketing
Board, CMB, said.
    "This has not been good for coffee producers, more so in a
situation where the prices dropped by 200 pounds per tonne of
robusta coffee," J. Makumbi said when he returned from London on
Friday.
    Producers and consumers failed to agree on a quota formula
to share the world's coffee production during International
Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks that ended last week.
    Makumbi blamed the failure to set quotas, which were
suspended in Feburary last year, on Indonesian demands that its
quota be increased dramatically.
    Uganda -- which earns about 400 mln dlrs annually from
coffee exports, over 95 pct of its foreign exchange earnings --
had sought to raise its ICO quota to 3.0 mln from 2.45 mln
60-kilo bags, according to sources close to the CMB.
    The CMB has estimated that production will rise 20 to 25
pct in the current 1986/87 October-September season to over
three mln bags.
    For several years Uganda had been unable to meet its ICO
export quota as rebel activity disrupted the coffee industry.
    The Ugandan government depends on coffee export duties for
about 60 pct of its sales tax revenue and the industry employs
over half of salaried manpower.
    In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's Agriculture and Livestock
Development Minister Paul Bomani said today Third World
countries would suffer from the failure of the London coffee
talks.
    "It is only the middlemen who will benefit, he said.
    Bomani called on the ICO to convene another meeting within
two months, saying, "Once tempers have cooled and delegations
have had time to report back to their headquarters, common
sense will prevail."

<title>BRITAIN, U.S. TO DISCUSS JAPAN TRADE RELATIONS</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, April 9 - </dateline>British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey
Howe and U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz plan to discuss
the growing crisis in trade relations with Japan in talks in
Washington, government officials said.
    Howe views the apparent deadlock in British attempts to
secure a greater share in Japanese domestic markets very
seriously, said an official travelling with him.
    Britain has threatened to impose retaliatory restrictions
on Japanese finance houses in London if Japan does not open up
its markets. The U.S. Has already imposed higher tariffs on
computer microchips imported from Japan.
    Michael Howard, the British minister for consumer and
corporate affairs, repeated the threat of sanctions before
leaving Tokyo yesterday at the end of a four-day visit during
which he failed to secure major concessions from the Japanese.
    Howe's main mission in Washington was to brief Shultz on
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to the Soviet Union
last week. Shultz is due to fly to Moscow next week.

shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at
least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.
    The official said Ecuador could resume exports after
repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links
jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast.
It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline,
the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters.
Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35
days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.
    The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the
12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the
pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil
accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as
60 pct of government revenues.
    Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping
about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd
above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy
Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of
173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.
    However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline,
costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian
pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take
about 60 days to build.
    Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986,
had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end
of January, about equal to one month's imports.
    It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion
dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's
total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in
Latin America.
    In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would
loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three
months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.
    Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies
and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in
repayment in May, Lusinchi said.
    A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister
Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior
and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de
Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and
co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

<title>ECUADOR DEPUTY MINISTER SEEKS OIL AID IN VENEZUELA</title>
<dateline>    CARACAS, March 11 - </dateline>Ecuador's deputy energy minister
Fernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks on
further Venezuelan assistance to his country's oil industry
following last week's earthquake, officials said.
    Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for an
expected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles of
pipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port of
Balao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports.
    Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lend
Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, to be repaid in kind after
180 days, to help meet its domestic consumption needs.
    The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports that
Venezuela will temporarily produce Ecuador's entire OPEC quota,
set at 210,000 barrels per day for first half 1987.
    "All options are open at this moment in the context of
cooperation on oil production," a Venezuelan energy and mines
ministry source said.
    Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula to
compensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while the
pipeline is repaired, officials said.
    Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and mines
minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks at
technical level, officials said.
    Industry sources said that among the options are for
Venezuela to produce Ecuador's entire quota, or for Venezuela
and non-OPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supply
Ecuador's Far Eastern clients.
    But the ministry source said that no decision has yet been
reached on the matter, and that an announcement would be made
in due course.
    Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would have
to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its
needs until the line was repaired.
    Ecuador energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran
said last night his country needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the
damage to the export pipeline caused by the earthquake.

<title>TEXACO (QTX) MAY BENEFIT FROM SEC BRIEF</title>
<author>    By Patti Domm, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, June 29 - </dateline>The Securities and Exchange
Commission's entry into the battle between Texaco Inc and
Pennzoil Co <PZL> could affect the outcome of the 10.3 billion
dlr legal saga, some analysts said.
    Texaco today said the SEC would file a "friend of the
court" brief on the tender offer rule as it pertains to the
case. Some analysts construed this as positive for Texaco since
they said it is alleged by Texaco that Pennzoil violated the
rule, and the issue was not thoroughly addressed in lower Texas
courts.
    Texaco's stock rose 1-1/2 to 39-3/8 and Pennzoil fell four
to 78-7/8. A Pennzoil attorney would not comment. He said the
SEC rule, 10b-13, is part of Texaco's argument in its request
for a Texas Supreme Court case, and that the matter has been
previously addressed in court. Pennzoil said it knew of the SEC
brief but it did not know whether the brief would support the
view of one litigant or be an inquiry and request for
clarification of the reasons for two lower state court
decisions.
    Texaco today said the SEC would urge the Texas Supreme
Court to accept the case for review with respect to the issue.
    Texaco has alleged Pennzoil violated the rule when it had a
tender offer for Getty Oil Co outstanding and then made an
alleged agreement on January 3, 1984, to buy Getty shares.
    Analysts said the SEC tender offer rule prevents those
making the offer from entering into contracts for the target
company's stock. Frederick Leuffer of C.J. Lawrence believes
SEC intervention could be meaningful but acknowledged it could
also have no affect. "If this friend of the court brief is
potent and clearly pro-Texaco, and is taken into account by the
Texas Supreme Court, there is a chance the entire judgment
could be reversed and Pennzoil gets nothing," Leuffer said.
    Texaco and Pennzoil have been locked in a bitter legal
battle over Texaco's acquisition of Getty Oil. A Texas court
awarded Pennzoil a record 10.53 billion dlrs in damages, later
reduced by two billion dlrs. With interest, the award now
totals 10.3 billion dlrs.
    Texaco filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy laws earlier this year. Its action was designed to
avoid having a Texas appeals court order it to post a security
bond for the entire amount of the Pennzoil judgement.
    Texaco earlier said the SEC will file its brief the week of
July 20.
    In his comments, Leuffer also reflected the views of other
analysts who believe are not convinced the SEC will play a
significant role. "The other argument is the court will ignore
it (the SEC brief) as it has all the other friend of the court
briefs," he said.
    Kidder Peabody and Co analyst Marc Cohen said he does not
expect the SEC's brief to change the direction of the case.
"Everyday, you're going to see something like this," Cohen
said.
    Texaco lawyer Jim Sales said it was only logical to believe
that the SEC would have sought to intervene in the case if it
believed the 10b-13 rule was involved. "I think what the market
sensed today is that there is a reminder here for Pennzoil that
they may reach for the stars and fall on their face," Sales
said. "They (Pennzoil) have won every case in Texas," said Joel
Fischer of Drexel Burnham Lambert. But Fischer and other
analysts said SEC involvement may raise questions of federal
law that could help Texaco take its case to the U.S. Supreme
Court if the Texas court does not reverse the lower opinions or
refuses to hear its case.
    Analysts said the lower courts did not give much weight to
the 10b-13 issue.
    Sales said the point was argued and the courts
"acknowledged that it was there but they really ignored the
legal affect of what the regulation required, and we hope we
can correct that misimpression".
    Wall Street analysts and arbitragers speculated on many
possible outcomes. One arbitrager said there was concern that
Texaco and Pennzoil could settle for a lower sum than demanded
by Pennzoil.
    "The SEC stepping in on this issue as an amicus curiae
(friend of the court) has a lot of arbitragers a little bit
disturbed," said Cohen.
    "What you're seeing is a continual chess game. Every slight
move down the road could have a multiplying effect," he said.

    The department said the sales will be subsidized with
commodities from the Commodity Credit Corporation, CCC,
inventory and the subsidy will enable U.S. exports to compete
at commercial prices in the Algerian market.
    Algeria has already purchased 300,000 tonnes of U.S. durum

<title>ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ASIAN DROUGHTS</title>
<author>    By Gavin Greenwood, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    HONG KONG, March 20 - </dateline>Three geographically diverse droughts
in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a
reintensification of the complex and little-understood El Nino
weather pattern, <Accu-Weather Inc>, a commercial weather
forecasting service, said.
    Rice and wheat farmers in China, wheat and sugarcane
growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face
serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive
in time to break the droughts, offical reports, government
officials and meteorologists said.
    Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links, said
the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces
have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months.
    Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces, it added.
    Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan
was 70 pct below average during February, the lowest figure for
over 20 years, the paper said.
    The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct
compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many
rivers, it added.
    This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power, causing
shortages to industry and households. The upper reaches of the
Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many
ships to run aground, Wen Wei Po said.
    Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across
China, media reports said. The People's Daily said Sichuan has
recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average
since early February.
    The New China News Agency said the average December
temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher
than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984.
    Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lanka
and threatens to reduce the country's tea crop, Ministry of
Plantation Industries officials told Reuters
    In Australia, concern is growing about below-average
rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the
Queensland coast and in Western Australia's wheat belt, local
Meteorological Bureau officials said.
    For many farmers and government officials the fear is that
while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major
threat, the prospect of a dry autumn/winter season when the
wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does, they added.
    Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982/83 drought
which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the
occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as
El Nino, they said.
    Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the
Asia-Pacific region's disrupted weather patterns to any single
cause, El Nino's role is being closely studied, they said.
    Accu-Weather Inc, which specialises in providing data for
agriculture and shipping interests, said each El Nino 'event'
was unique.
    The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and
the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last
major event in 1982/83, it said.
    El Nino, Spanish for "Christ Child" because it appears around
Christmas, is formed by the action of warm air, bearing clouds
and rain, shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast
of Peru, where it mingles with the cold waters associated with
the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade
winds, meteorologists said.
    The winds, strengthened by El Nino's "pump" effect, raise the
sea level off Australia and Indonesia, they said.
    When the winds drop, the ocean, seeking equilibrium, sends
a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it
collides with the cold seas off Peru, they said.
    One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the
rain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the
Pacific, where they further disrupt other weather patterns.
    The prospects for an end to the droughts vary, Accu-Weather
said.
    China, where the affected areas have received between 40
and 75 pct of normal rainfall, will have to wait for the
May-September rains, it said.
    The May-September rains normally provide the
drought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall.
    In Australia, areas of Queensland's coastal strip have
received less than half the normal rainfall during the current
wet season, but prospects for increased rains are diminishing
as the rainy season draws to an end.
    In Sri Lanka, the drought has come when rainfall should be
at its maximum for the year. The year's secondary rains usually
occur between April and June, although it is not possible at
this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual.

<title>BARCLAYS, MIDLAND FOLLOW NATWEST BASE RATE CUT</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 9 - </dateline>Barclays Bank Plc <BCS.L> and Midland
Bank Plc <MDBL.L> said they are cutting their base lending
rates to 10.5 pct from 11 pct. The cuts follow a similar move
by National Westminster Bank Plc <NWBL.L>
    The rate changes take effect tomorrow.
    The base rate reductions came after the Bank of England cut
its dealing rates this morning in a signal to the money markets
that it would not resist a half percentage point drop in bank
base lending rates, market sources said.
    Until the end of last week, the central was holding out
staunchly against market pressures for lower rates in an
apparent effort to preserve the expected rate cuts for around
the time of the government's annual Budget on March 17.
    Sterling remained firm around 1.59 dlrs compared with its
close here on Friday at 1.5865 dlrs.

stg and compares with its forecast of a two billion stg
shortage in the system today.

<title>FISONS RAISING 110 MLN STG IN SHARE PLACING</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 27 - </dateline>Fisons Plc <FISN.L> said it planned to
raise about 110 mln stg through an international placing of up
to 18 mln new shares, mainly in Europe and the Far East.
    The operation would be conducted by a syndicate of
international banks led by <County Securities Ltd>.
    The issue would not be underwritten and shares would only
be allocated to syndicate banks to meet true demand from
end-investors. The share price would be determined according to
market conditions, but its expected that it would be at the
middle market price.
    A Fisons statement said that although the pharmaceutical
group achieved more than 80 pct of its sales outside the U.K.,
With rapidly increasing interest from international investors,
less than two pct of its shares were held overseas.
    The issue would help meet this interest, enhance the
group's standing in the capital markets and increase demand for
its shares. The issue would also be a cost effective way of
raising new equity, it said.
    The new funds would be used for the developing of existing
operations and also for acquisitions if suitable opportunities
arose.
    The issue, which represents 5.5 pct of the company's
authorised capital, requires shareholder approval. A meeting
has been arranged for April 21.
    Fisons shares eased one penny on the announcement by 0830
GMT to 657p.

<title>REAGAN EXTENDS U.S. COOPERATION WITH EURATOM</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 9 - </dateline>President Reagan signed an order 
allowing sales of U.S. nuclear fuel to the European Atomic
Energy Community (EURATOM) to continue for a further year, even
though they do not comply with a 1978 U.S. law.
    Under the law, which is designed to combat the spread of
nuclear weapons, foreign importers of U.S. nuclear fuel must
get American consent to any reprocessing.
    The United States and EURATOM have had a series of 11
rounds of talks from 1978 to 1986 to renegotiate its nuclear
cooperation agreements, signed more than 20 years ago, to
conform with the 1978 law.
    Since 1978 the U.S.-EURATOM nuclear coooperation accords
have been extended by a series of presidential waiver orders.
    State Department officials said negotiations had made more
progress in the last two years after the United States had
offered a longterm reprocessing consent arrangement, rather
than requiring EURATOM to have U.S. consent for each fuel
delivery.
     In notifying Congress of today's order extending
U.S.-EURATOM nuclear cooperation, Reagan said: "A disruption of
nuclear cooperation would not only eliminate any chance of
progress in our talks with EURATOM related to our agreements,
it would also cause serious problems in our relationships."
      He said further progress in talks with EURATOM was 
expected this year.

<title>BRAZIL COCOA EXPORTERS UNLIKELY TO LIMIT SALES</title>
<dateline>    RIO DE JANEIRO, APRIL 9 - </dateline>Brazilian cocoa exporters are not
likely to follow the example of Cocoa Producers Alliance, CPA,
members, who may limit sales of the product in an effort to
boost world prices, trade sources said.
    They said a similar procedure was taken in the past in
Brazil and that it did not work out according to plans.
    "The cocoa market is completely free. Unlike coffee, which
is controlled through export registrations, cocoa exporters in
Brazil operate at their own free will," a trade source said.
    The traders were responding to questions whether they would
follow the example of CPA members meeting in Yaounde.
    The sources said the Banco do Brasil's Foreign Trade
Department, CACEX, never interferes in the cocoa market by
rejecting sales that do not meet certain price or shipment
criteria.
    "The position of local producers is always to negotiate as
they please. If they buy for ten and sell for eleven and think
it's a good deal, they are free to go ahead," one source added.

<dateline>    SEOUL, June 3 - </dateline>South Korea's wholesale price index, base
1980, rose 0.4 pct to 127.0 in May after a 1.1 pct rise in
April and was 1.5 pct higher than in May 1986, the Bank of
Korea said.
    The May consumer price index, which has the same base, rose
1.4 pct to 149.1 after a 0.3 pct gain in April, for a
year-on-year rise of 3.5 pct.
    Wholesale prices rose 2.0 pct in the first five months of
1986, while consumer prices rose by 3.2 pct. Bank officials
said the rises were due to a strong yen which made imports of
Japanese parts, raw and intermediary materials more expensive.

<title>WEINBERGER OPPOSES FUJITSU BUYING U.S. FIRM</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 12 - </dateline>Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger
will join Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige in fighting
Fujitsu Ltd's <ITSU.T> plan to buy 80 pct of <Fairchild
Semiconductor Corp>, Pentagon officials said.
    "He (Weinberger) opposes it. It is not in the best interests
of the country to have more of the micro-electronics business
leaving the United States," one of the Pentagon officials, who
asked not to be identified, told Reuters.
    Commerce Department officials told Reuters yesterday that
Baldrige opposed the planned sale and that the White House
Economic Policy Council will take up the matter within weeks.
    Commerce and defense officials said Baldrige and Weinberger
feared the U.S. military is already leaning too heavily on
foreign electronic support.
    But the Defense Department also said today that Weinberger
and Baldrige differed on the proposed sale of U.S. computer
equipment to Iran.
    The Commerce Department advised the Pentagon recently that
defense objections to two proposed sales -- to an Iranian power
company and the Islamic Republic of Iran News Agency -- were
not valid and the sales of small and medium computers would go
through unless more evidence was presented.

<title>BOLIDEN SAYS RESULTS BURDENED BY LOSS WRITEOFF</title>
<dateline>     STOCKHOLM, Mar 12 - </dateline>Swedish mining and metals group
Boliden AB <BLDS ST> forecast a return to profitability during
1987 after recording a 1.08 billion crown 1986 loss burdened by
a massive write-off.
    The company, which consolidated the Swedish wholesale and
investment conglomerate <Ahlsell AB> this year, said the result
included restructuring costs and write-offs of 802 mln crowns.
    "These costs have arisen as a results of a change of
direction for the group. They are mainly one-off but they have
burdened the annual accounts," the company said in a statement.
    Boliden said the company's liquid assets were 1.36 billion
crowns at year-end which together with an investment portfolio
of 1.60 billion made it one of the most liquid Swedish
companies.
    As a result of the 1986 losses, the board proposed
cancelling dividend for the year although it predicted a return
to profitability during 1987, the statement added.
    Swedish tyres, process equipment and components firm
<Trelleborg AB> has taken a majority stake in Boliden since the
beginning of this year. Trelleborg then said it had no plans
for consolidating Boliden.

<title>TREASURY OFFICIAL SAYS PHILIPPINE PACT VERY NEAR</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 12 - </dateline>An agreement in the debt rescheduling
talks between the Philippines and its commercial bank advisory
committee seems to be close at hand, said David Mulford,
Assistant Secretary of the U.S. Treasury.
    "The Philippines negotiations resumed in early March and
agreement now appears to be very near," Mulford told a debt
conference, organized by the Euromoney magazine.
    Mulford gave no further details. He told reporters after
his speech that he had no information on the banks' response to
the Philippines' revised proposal, based on partial payment of
interest with investment notes instead of cash.
    Progress in the Philippines talks, following recent
agreements with Mexico, Chile and Venezuela, will help to
dispel concerns of a new debt crisis, Mulford told the
conference.
    However, he said there will continue to be difficulties and
periods of significant risk, requiring creative thinking on the
part of the banks.
    In particular, he urged the banks to develop a "menu of
options for supporting debtor reforms as a means of maintaining
broad bank participation in new financing packages."
    Mulford said the banks should be able to offer a range of
options to members of the lending syndicates, provided that the
liquidity value of the total transactions to the debtor nations
is equivalent to the banks' new money obligation.
    He said it is more important to find ways of encouraging
banks to remain in the syndicates than to find ways of enabling
them to quit the lending groups.
    Mulford said his menu of options could include more trade
credits, direct portfolio investments, debt/equity swaps,
project loans, co-financings and the invesmtent note concept,
which has been proposed by the Philippines.

<title>CANADIAN BANKER SAYS BRAZIL ECONOMIC GROWTH VITAL</title>
<dateline>    BRASILIA, MARCH 13 - </dateline>William Mulholland, president of the
Bank of Montreal, said here it is important for Brazil to seek
its economic growth.
    Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Brazilian
Finance Minister Dilson Funaro, the Canadian banker said he
suggested to Funaro the conversion of Brazil's 1.3 billion
dollars debt with the Bank of Montreal by direct investments in
this country.
    He said the Brazilian minister was impressed with his
initiative and that he (Funaro) had submitted the proposal to
the Central Bank for a broader analysis.
    Commenting on Brazil's decision to suspend payment of
interests to private creditor banks, Mulholland said he would
rather see that it did not happen, but that he understood the
decision made by the Brazilian government:
    "A country like Brazil cannot stop growing. Of course, it
must also seek an internal adjustment capable of controlling
the spiral of its inflation and public deficit," he said.
    He suggested Brazil and the international financial
community to work together and seek stable conditions to face
the problems of this country's foreign debt.

adopted today by the government, allows the Finance Ministry to
issue up to 14,600 billion yen worth of foreign exchange fund
financing bills, government sources said.
    Foreign exchange dealers said the yen funds would be used
to buy dollars, to prevent a further dollar fall.
    The government sources said the amount, covering the first
50 days of the year starting April 1, accounts for more than 90
pct of the 16,000 billion yen in bills incorporated in the full
budget.

<title>NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN</title>
<author>    By Eric Hall, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 5 - </dateline>The highly visible drama involving the
yen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact
that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major
European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate
distortions, Japanese and European research officials said.
    The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements
by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the
currency movements of the past two years are also creating a
fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new
trade tensions and imbalances.
    Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are
already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan-
European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.
    In many ways, not least in terms of rare international
cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between
the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down
the value of the dollar was a historic one.
    But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major
currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which
the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not
necessarily central significance, the officials said.
    The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took
place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement
simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in
Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.
    "You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now,
and that was well before Plaza," he said.
    On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at
263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was
242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and
periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the
dollar trend has been down, down, down.
    Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross
rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The
European currencies are moving back up against the yen.
    The close relationship between exchange rates and trade
flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but
undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is
changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC
both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen.
This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.
    Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of
of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.
    Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12
pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports
and 21 pct for imports in yen terms.
    "The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a
tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit
sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important
to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is
laying the golden egg," said de Hora.
    The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year
in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its
start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.
    The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than
U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate
imbalance, and which will cause problems.
    "This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is
reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But
therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive
edge," said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International
Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. "If you want
my objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our
trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports,
and this year we may have to do so again," he said.

<title>AEGON EXPECTS MODERATE RISE IN 1987 PROFITS</title>
<dateline>    THE HAGUE, April 9 - </dateline>Dutch insurer AEGON NV <AEGN.AS>
reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln
guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits
for 1987.
    Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion
guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its
revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a
change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would
have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.
    Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly
due to its life insurance business.
    Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose
despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and
higher personal risks.
    Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage
insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.
    In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and
life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change
in accounting for U.S. Annuities.
    AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal
investment influences that it should be accounted differently
from the more traditional insurances.
    This change in accounting practice and another change to
account for profits made on fixed interest investments,
resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln
guilders.
    AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits
were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial
costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The
Hague.
    In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged
in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial
costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.
    Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in
May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these
costs and made only a small contribution to the group's
profits.
    AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill
for Monumental Corp.
    AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December
1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.

<title>U.S. APPEARS TO TOLERATE FURTHER DLR DECLINE</title>
<author>    By Peter Torday, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 30 - </dateline>In a bid to hasten Japan's promise
to speed up its economic growth and open markets to foreign
trade, top U.S. officials appear once again to have signaled
their tolerance of a lower dollar.
    Treasury Secretary James Baker and one of his top aides,
Assistant Secretary David Mulford, said last week there was no
target for the dollar, a statement that sent the yen soaring
against the dollar, despite massive central bank intervention.
    "That was no slip of the tongue," said one western monetary
official, who asked not to be identified.
    For now, the strategy appears to be working. Japanese
officials said late last week a package to bolster domestic
demand will be ready in early April. Until last week, there
were few indications the package would be ready anytime soon.
    The Reagan administration, facing an uproar in Congress
over the apparent lack of progress in cutting the 169.8 billion
dlr trade deficit, is learning now that to extract results from
Japan, dramatic action is required.
    Last week the White House imposed unprecedented tariffs on
certain Japanese electronic goods after Tokyo failed to adhere
to a semi-conductor pricing accord between the two countries.
    The shift in U.S. strategy, in part designed to appease
mounting Congressional anger over Japanese policies, comes just
two weeks before industrial nations reconvene here to review
the Paris agreement to stabilize currencies.
    And news that Japan earned a record 18 billion dlr trade
surplus in the first two months this year just underscored the
need for urgent action, in the view of U.S. officials.
    Nonetheless, U.S. officials see signs of improvement in the
deficit. "I'd be stunned if we were not going to derive some
benefits (from the lower dollar) soon," said one.
    In Paris, leading industrial nations agreed to cooperate
closely to foster currency stability within ranges reflecting
"underlying economic fundamentals" or economic reality.
    The agreement envisages those fundamentals to include Japan
and West Germany stimulating their economies and the United
States cutting its budget deficit.
    The three nations, joined by France, Britain and Canada,
agree these policies are essential to redress huge global trade
imbalances.
    But analysts say markets have signalled the underlying
fundamentals imply a lower dollar, rather than a stable one.
    Markets, in effect, are less confident than governments
that these measures -- including U.S. budget deficit cuts
agreed by Congress and the White House --will be carried out.
    Nonetheless, the dollar's sharp fall has not undermined 
cooperation. A U.S. economic policymaker said the accord was on
track and Tokyo and Bonn seem "to want more stimulative measures
which is what the Paris accord calls for."
    International monetary sources said exchange market
developments generally have not unsettled policymakers,
although Japan is an obvious exception. "Everybody feels it can
still be managed," one source said of market developments.
    But last week, the Bank of Japan spent an estimated five
billion dlrs intervening to halt the rise in the yen, and other
central banks about one billion dlrs.
    Another monetary source said Japan was upset with America's
half-hearted attempt to halt the falling dollar, flouting the
Paris accord outright.
    The source, close to the top levels of Japanese economic
policymaking, said Japan's understanding of the accord was that
the yen would be kept at around 154 to the dollar, the level it
stood at when the accord was struck.
    The source said Tokyo was extremely worried by Washington's
use of the exchange rate to change Japanese policies. It was a
"pointed reminder" to Japan to do something about the trade
issues, the source said of the dollar's fall against the yen.
    By departing last Sunday from the language of the Paris
accord -- that nations agreed to foster currency stability
around current levels -- Baker triggered a run on the dollar.
    Later in the week, Mulford too said there was no target for
the dollar and called on Japan and West Germany to live up to
their international responsibilities and stimulate growth.
    But U.S. officials said recent market developments will not
unravel the spirit of the Paris agreement.
    "There's a realisation now that you cannot leave things
alone, everyone agrees that the external (trade) imbalances
ought to be adjusted," one official said.
    "While no-one is going to cede national sovereignty, we
certainly seem to be moving towards much closer co-operation,"
another U.S. official said.
    The officials said the meeting here, where the six will be
joined by Italy, will be a status report.
    "Japan will have to explain what the state of their program
is and Germany will report on its plans. Maybe there's a need
to move faster," one source said.
    Mulford told Congress last week the Paris accord called, in
effect, for currency stability for several months. This would
buy time for Japan and West Germany to speed up their economic
growth and help bring down the U.S. trade deficit.
    His comments appeared to serve notice on other major
nations that Washington cannot wait too long for action to
reduce the gap between the Japanese and German trade surpluses
and the U.S. trade deficit.

<dateline>    TEL AVIV, April 9 - </dateline>Israeli helicopter gunships attacked
Palestinian guerrilla positions near Sidon in southern Lebanon
today in the ninth air raid over Lebanon this year, the
military spokesman said.
    "All our aircraft returned safely to base and the pilots
reported accurate hits," he said. The aircraft returned ground
fire, he said.
    The targets, three buildings on the outskirts of Ain
el-Hilweh refugee camp, were command posts for planning
guerrilla attacks, the military said.
    The army says Israel's air raids on its northern neighbour,
averaging two a month, are aimed mostly at Palestinian
guerrilla bases, weapons depots and launching posts for attacks
against Israel.
    The last Israeli Air Force attack was on March 23.

<title>CBOE TO LIST NEW S AND P OPTIONS APRIL 20</title>
<dateline>    CHICAGO, April 9 - </dateline>The Chicago Board Options Exchange,
CBOE, said it will list new Standard and Poor 500 stock index
options beginning April 20 that will trade side-by-side with
the existing S and P 500 options.
    The new S and P 500 option contract differs from the
existing contract in that settlement of the new contract will
be based on the opening value of the index on expiration
Friday. Settlement of the existing contract is based on the
closing value of the index on expiration Friday.
    The new opening settlement S and P 500 options will be
offered only in months in which there are S and P 500 futures.
    Initial months to be listed in the new options will be
June, September and December, the CBOE said.
    Dissemination of the settlement price of the new options
will be made through a special ticker symbol -- <SET>, the
exchange said.
    There will initially be seven series of strike prices for
each contract month of the new options -- one strike price "at
the money," or near to the actual spot index value, and three
above and three below the spot index.
    Position limits in any combination of both the new and
existing S and P 500 options will be 15,000 contracts.
    The exchange said in the rare event that a stock does not
open on expiration Friday, the previous day's closing price of
that stock will be used to calculate the settlement value of
the index.

<title>JAPAN SEEN CUTTING APRIL BOND COUPON FROM FIVE PCT</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 26 - </dateline>The underwriting syndicate expects the
Finance Ministry to propose a 0.2 to 0.3 percentage point cut
in the coupon of the 10-year government bond to be issued in
April from the five pct March issue, underwriting sources said.
    The expected proposal is likely to await passage of a
provisional budget for 1987/88 starting April 1 by the Lower
House of Parliament on March 30, the sources said.
    Issue volume is likely to be 1,200 to 1,400 billion yen
against 475 billion in March, they said. Projected issue price
is around par against 99.50 for the March bond, they said.

<title>SYRIA PROPOSES REDUCED BUDGET FOR 1987</title>
<dateline>    DAMASCUS, March 17 - </dateline>The government proposed a 1987 budget
of up to 41.7 billion Syrian pounds, a 4.8 pct decrease from
last year's allocation.
    Finance minister Qahtan Seyoufi told parliament last night
the reduction was due mainly to a cut in investment
allocations.
    Planned recurrent spending of 24.2 billion pounds, almost
unchanged from 1986, took account of national security needs
and "Syria's role in steadfastness and liberation," he said.
    The budget, which is still subject to approval by
parliament and by President Hafez al-Assad, also aims to meet
mounting spending on education, health and essential imports.
    Power and water projects would take up 43.5 pct of
investment allocations of 17.5 billion pounds and agriculture
about 20 pct, Seyoufi said.
    The budget's basic goals were to restrict current spending,
curb inflation and step up reliance on local resources, he
said.

<title>U.S. SENATE LEADER WANTS BUDGET PASSED THIS WEEK</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 27 - </dateline>Senate majority leader Robert Byrd
said he wants the Senate to pass by late Friday a fiscal 1988
budget that starts reducing the flow of U.S. debt.
    The Democratic leader told a news conference and later the
Senate itself that the Senate would debate the measure today
even though technically the first procedural vote --on formally
bringing up the vital measure for action--would not take place
until tomorrow afternoon.
    The pending budget would cut some 38 billion dlrs from an
anticipated deficit that would occur without any action.
    Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole also said he wanted quick
action on the budget measure this week, before Friday afternoon
when some Republicans want to leave town.
    Dole said a Republican substitute probably would be offered
to the Democratic-written budget which would reduce the
estimated 1988 deficit of about 171 billion dlrs to about 134
billion dlrs, through cuts in defence and social spending and
some 18.5 billion dlrs in unspecified tax hikes in 1988.
    The House, also controlled by Democrats, has passed a
similar budget which would have to be reconciled with a Senate
plan. President Reagan's budget was defeated in the House.

<title>VIOLENCE REPORTED IN ECUADOR GENERAL STRIKE</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, March 26 - </dateline>At least 14 people were injured and many
arrested in clashes during a one-day general strike called by
Ecuadorean workers to protest against austerity measures
imposed after a major earthquake on March 5.
    Interior Minister Luis Robles said the worst violence was
in Quito, where demonstrators threw rocks at a luxury hotel and
a number of banks.
    Over 80 people in eight cities were detained for stoning
police, attacking troops, damaging buildings and setting fire
to cars, he said. The casualty and damage toll is expected to
rise as detailed reports reach the capital from the provinces.
    Labour leaders said they shut down all of Ecuador's
industrial plants, but Labour Minister Jorge Egas said of the
country's 900 largest factories only 86 were closed, 32 were
partially working and the rest operating normally.
    The strike, called by leftist unions and declared illegal
by the government, was aimed at pressing the administration to
scrap an austerity program adopted on March 13 following an
earthquake that killed up to 1,000 people and caused an
estimated billion dlrs in damage.

<dateline>    SEOUL, April 4 - </dateline>South Korea ordered the takeover of six
financially troubled overseas construction firms and two
shipping companies under the government's industrial
realignment programme, Finance Ministry officials said.
    They said the Industrial Policy Deliberation Committee
decided to allow concessionary loans to three firms taking over
the eight. The companies involved would be exempted from
corporate tax and property transfer and registration taxes.
    Under the programme, five subsidaries of <Chung Woo
Development Co Ltd> will be taken over by <Byuck San Corp>,
<Korea Develpoment Corp> by <Daelim Industrial Co Ltd>, and two
subsidaries of <Korea Shipping Corp> by the <Hanjin Group>.
    Another five construction companies were ordered to improve
their financial status by reorganising their subsidiaries or
selling off unproductive real estate holdings to help repay
bank loans, the officials said.
    These are <Pacific Construction Co Ltd>, <Life Construction
Co Ltd>, <Chin Heung International Co Ltd>, <Samick Co Ltd> and
<Hanshin Construction Co Ltd>.
    A further five shipping companies -- <Hanjin Container Line
Ltd>, <Choyang Shipping Co Ltd>, <Hyundai Merchant Marine Co
Ltd>, <Pan Ocean Shipping Co> and <Dooyang Line Co Ltd> -- will
be allowed to defer the repayment of bank loans and interest,
but details have yet to be finalised, the officials said.
    They said the government would take similar measures for
more companies in August in line with the continuing
realignment policy, which had already affected 56 firms last
year.

    "We have now cleared three auctions and are left with only
four, worth eight mln dlrs," the spokesman said without
specifying the amount paid out.
    The bank had not paid foreign exchange to private firms
since it suspended the weekly auctions on January 28.
    It has said the auctions were suspended because it planned
to introduce a modified system after talks with the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund.
    President Kenneth Kaunda announced last month that the
auction would be retained for allocating foreign exchange to
approved private sector bidders, but would not be used to
determine the kwacha's exchange rate.
    Last week, he said the auction had run into trouble because
of a shortage of foreign exchange.
    The government has fixed the exchange rate at nine kwacha
per dollar, effectively revaluing the kwacha by 67.7 pct.

<title>BORG-WARNER AGREES TO BUYOUT BY MERRILL LYNCH FIRM</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 13 - </dateline>Borg-Warner <BOR> Corp, facing an
unwanted offer from GAF Corp <GAF>, agreed to a 4.23 billion
dlr buyout offer from a company to be formed by <Merrill Lynch
Capital Partners Inc>.
    Borg-Warner and Merrill said yesterday they entered a
definitive merger agreement, under which a subsidiary of the
new company, <AV Holdings Corp>, will begin a 48.50 dlr per
share cash tender offer today for 77.6 mln shares or 89 pct of
Borg-Warner common stock.
    The offer will be followed by a merger in which each
remaining share will be converted into 19.75 dlrs cash and
54.25 dlrs principal amount of AV Holdings junior subordinated
discount debentures.
    As a result of the merger, Borg-Warner will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of AV Holdings. A Borg-Warner spokeswoman said
members of management do not plan to participate in the
transaction, but they will retain their positions with the
company.
    A spokesman for GAF was unavailable for comment. GAF holds
19.9 pct of Borg-Warner's shares.
    GAF had said it would offer 46 dlrs per share.
    Borg-Warner's spokeswoman said the company still plans to
sell its financial services unit, which includes Wells Fargo
security guards, and the Chilton Corp, a credit rating service.
    Borg-Warner has been the focus of takeover speculation for
about a year. Corporate raider Irwin Jacobs last year proposed
a takeover of the firm and until recently held 10 pct of the
stock. Following the GAF offer, analysts had calculated breakup
values for the company in the low 50 dlrs per share range and
speculated an offer would have to be sweetened.
    In its statement, Borg-Warner said its board endorsed the
Merrill offer and it recommended that shareholders tender their
shares. The board received opinions on the offer from its
advisors, First Boston Corp and Goldman, Sachs and Co.
    James Burke, president of Merrill Lynch Capital Partners,
said, "We are very pleased to have entered into this transaction
with Borg-Warner. We are looking forward to working with the
employees of Borg-Warner and to Borg-Warner maintaining its
strong presence in the Chicago community."
    Merrill Lynch will be the dealer-manager for the offer,
which expires at midnight EDT May 8 (0400 GMT, May 9), subject
to conditions, including the completion of necessary financing
arrangements.
    The offer is also subject to a minimum 44.25 mln shares, or
51 pct of the outstanding shares, being tendered.
    Merrill Lynch and certain affiliates have committed to
provide 200 mln dlrs in AV Holdings equity and 870 mln in
subordinated financing and forward underwriting commitments.
    Merrill Lynch said that following discussions with
commercial banks it is confident it can obtain the rest of the
financing required to complete the transaction.
    The junior subordinated discount debentures to be issued in
the merger will carry a 13 pct coupon and will begin paying
cash interest after five years.
    The debentures will be redeemable at the company's option
for the first six years at 105 pct, during the seventh year at
102.5 pct and after that at 100 pct of the principal amount.
    The junior subordinated discount debentures have a maturity
of 20 years and are entitled to a sinking fund commencing in
the 16th year designed to retire 60 pct of the issue before
maturity.
    Borg-Warner will also redeem all of its outstanding 4.50
dlrs cumulative preferred stock, series A, for 100 dlrs per
share. Holders who wish to participate in the offer must first
convert their preferred stock into Borg-Warner common stock.
    The board of Borg-Warner has also taken steps to redeem its
poison pill or share purchase rights for five cents per right,
effective immediately.

<title>BANK OF SPAIN GOVERNOR SAYS MONEY GROWTH TOO FAST</title>
<dateline>    MADRID, April 2 - </dateline>Bank of Spain governor Mariano Rubio said
the central bank was worried that money supply was growing too
fast, reflecting excessive internal demand in the Spanish
economy, but added that he was confident recent measures would
succeed in restricting money growth.
    In testimony to the economic commission of Congress, Rubio
said the main measure of money supply, the broad-based Liquid
Assets in Public Hands, grew at an estimated annualised rate of
17 pct in March, the same as in February.
    The bank's target range for growth in this measure in 1987
is 6.5 to 9.5 pct, compared with 11.4 pct last year.
    Rubio said he was aiming for the lower end of the range.
    He added that real GDP growth of three pct in 1986 was due
to a six pct increase in real internal demand and a three pct
real drop in the contribution of the external sector.
    The aim for 1987 was for the same real growth in GDP but a
drop in the internal contribution to 4.5 pct with the negative
component of the external sector trimmed to 1.5 pct, he said.

<title>SUBROTO SAYS EXTENSION OF TIN PACT IS UNREALISTIC</title>
<dateline>    JAKARTA, April 6 - </dateline>An extension of the International Tin
Agreement (ITA) is unrealistic and the pact should be allowed
to lapse, Indonesian Mines and Energy Minister Subroto told
reporters.
    Asked about Jakarta's position for the quarterly session of
the International Tin Council on April 8-9, Subroto said
Indonesia had agreed to the formation of a study group to look
into how to replace the pact.
    But he said that given the present disagreement between
producers and consumers, there is unlikely to be any follow-up
to the ITA.
    Asked by reporters if Indonesia would support an extension
of the ITA, he said, "No one will propose that. It's also
unrealistic to do so."
    Subroto played a key part in securing agreement between the
seven member Association of Tin Producing Countries to
introduce a quota system which limited their exports and
consumption to 96,000 tonnes in the year starting March 1.
    Indonesia's quota was set at 24,516 tonnes.

<title>SHULTZ SAYS U.S. WHEAT BONUS OFFER UP TO USDA</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 28 - </dateline>U.S. Secretary of State George
Shultz said it was up to the Agriculture Department to decide
whether to offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union.
    Shultz told the Newspaper Farm Editors of America that a 
wheat bonus offer to the Soviet Union "is something that I
basically leave to the Agriculture Department to figure out."
    Last year, Shultz spoke out against President Reagan's
decision to offer subsidized U.S. wheat to the Soviet Union --
an offer Moscow spurned.
    "I've always been a little put off by the idea that we would
arrange our food supplies so as to price them in such a way
that the Soviet housewife could buy American-produced food for
less than the American housewife could buy it," Shultz said.
    "It also seems to me that if we are going to sell in world
markets, we have to meet the price," he added.
    Shultz called proposals to broaden the eligibility criteria
of USDA's export enhancement program (EEP) to include all U.S.
customers "questionable."
    An across-the-board EEP would mark a "considerable change" in
the current program, which Shultz said is designed "to say to
other countries that subsidize, particularly the European
Common Market, that we're not going to give up our markets to
those subsidized sales and we'll have a little kit bag that
will meet that competition and hold our markets for our
farmers."
    "If you just go across-the-board and subsidize everything,
that's a different order of program and seems to me quite
questionable," he said.

<title>SRI LANKA TO LAUNCH APPEAL FOR DROUGHT AID</title>
<dateline>    COLOMBO, March 26 - </dateline>Sri Lanka will appeal to its major aid
donors for at least 21 mln dlrs in financial support to help it
overcome the country's worst drought in 26 years.
    Government officials told Reuters that letters detailing
the extent of the drought would be sent this week to the 14
countries that gave some 700 mln dlrs in development aid to Sri
Lanka last year. These include Australia, Canada, Japan,
Britain, the U.S. And West Germany.
    Officials in the Finance and Planning Ministry coordinating
the aid request said Sri Lanka wanted the money over a
six-month period.
    Foreign Minister Tyronne Fernando last week briefed
representatives of aid-donor countries and international relief
agencies on the drought and made a general appeal for help.
    The state had disbursed 800,000 dlrs by February for the
most badly affected districts, but the Finance and Planning
Ministry officials said no further relief was available from
the budget.

<title>BRAZIL COTTON CROP LOWER -- USDA REPORT</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </dateline>Brazil's 1986/87 cotton crop estimate
has been reduced to 710,000 from 735,000 tonnes (lint basis),
the U.S. Agriculture Department's officer in Sao Paulo said in
a field report.
    The report, dated April 7, said the reduction is based on
an expected smaller harvest in the center-south region.
    The center-south crop is now estimated at 550,000 tonnes --
25,000 tonnes below the previous estimate.
    Hot, dry weather during part of January and excessive rains
in some areas in February reduced yield prospects and may have
affected quality, the report said.
    Nearly 60 pct of the crop has been harvested in Parana and
slightly less in Sao Paulo, it said. Cotton entering gins is of
fairly good quality, according to trade sources, it said.

    The program offers a U.S. Dlr option whereby commercial
paper in denominations of 100,000 U.S. Dlrs will be issued
subject to the same underwriting margin.
    Joining Schroders as underwriters are Barclays Bank Plc,
Citicorp International Ltd, Paribas Asia Ltd, Sanwa

<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 24 - </dateline>The U.S. Agriculture Department has
narrowed by three cents the price differential between the
Louisiana Gulf price of corn and posted country prices pegged
to the gulf price, USDA officials said.
    The change, effective April 27, means posted county prices
will be three cents higher in the region, Robert Sindt,
assistant deputy administrator of USDA's Agricultural
Stabilization and Conservation Service, said.
    Trade sources said USDA adjusted the differentials because
gulf prices had shown some weakness in recent days compared
with the rest of the country.
    Sindt said Louisiana Gulf corn price differentials that had
been between four and eight cents would, effective Monday,
range between one and five cents.
    Trade sources said cash bids at the Louisiana Gulf have
been between three and 4.5 cents weaker than in the rest of the
country in recent days, and that USDA's move would strengthen
the front end of the corn market.

administration's energy security report was based on flawed
economic assumptions.
    The New Mexico Republican said the report did not take into
account the last few weeks' drop in domestic oil production in
its statement that an oil fee would raise prices for consumers.
The report said a decline in economic growth as a result of the
fee would reduce tax revenues. "A five dlr (per barrel) oil
import fee will provide the stimulus to create jobs and
investment, " and raise revenues, he said.

<dateline>    TOKYO, June 19 - </dateline>C. Itoh and Co Ltd <CITT.T> said its group
net profit in the year ending March 31, 1988, is expected to be
unchanged from a year earlier.
    The prediction assumes a yen/dollar rate of 140 yen and a
crude oil price of 18 dlrs a barrel, a company spokesman told
Reuters. Sales in 1987/88 are estimated at 15,100 billion yen,
up 2.3 pct from a year earlier.
    The company earlier reported group net profit of 20.07
billion yen in the year ended March 31, 1987, up 8.6 pct from a
year earlier, helped by a drop in sales and administration
costs and reduced interest charges.

<title>JAPAN STUDY URGES FOREIGN ACCESS TO FARM MARKETS</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, April 3 - </dateline>Japan should increase foreign access to
its farm products market, while encouraging further development
of domestic agriculture, a government report said.
    The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31
said active participation in writing world farm trade rules at
the next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
talks will help prepare Japan to improve access.
    Agriculture Ministry sources said the paper marked an
easing in Japan's tough position on agricultural imports which
stressed the need for strict controls on some products to
maintain self-sufficiency in food.
    Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs,
down from 61 pct some 20 years ago, official figures show.
    The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow to
improve productivity and demand/supply imbalances.
    The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainly
responsible for higher domestic prices, it said.
    The strong yen has meant lower input material prices but
has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has
worsened working conditions among part-time farmers, the paper
said.
    This could make it difficult to improve the industry's
structure, the paper said.
    To solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices
to more reasonable levels, Japan should try to restructure the
the agricultural sector to improve productivity and make it
self-supporting, it said.

<title>NAKASONE DEFENDS SALES TAX AS CAMPAIGNING BEGINS</title>
<author>    By Yuko Nakamikado, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 23 - </dateline>Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone defended
his tax reform plans from fierce opposition, even within his
own party, as campaigning for local elections began.
    "Our plan to reform the nation's tax system is by no means
wrong. Unless we reform the system now, Japan is bound to
decay, perhaps within the next 10 years," Nakasone told
supporters of his ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP).
    The April 12 and 26 elections will be the first nationwide
vote since the LDP's general election victory last July.
    Opposition parties have shown rare unity in joining to
fight a proposed five pct sales tax, one of the main planks in
the tax reform package, and are now challenging the
LDP-dominated local governments and assemblies.
    In Tokyo, incumbent Governor Shunichi Suzuki backed by the
LDP and two centrist parties has said he cannot support the
sales tax as it stands.
    A survey by the National Broadcasting Corporation just over
three weeks ago showed 70 pct of those polled said they would
take the tax, which Nakasone proposes to implement next
January, into consideration when they vote.
    Takako Doi, Chairwoman of the Japan Socialist Party, said
in a speech in central Tokyo where shop-owners are opposing the
tax "The elections are a plebiscite against the sales tax. Your
vote is a vote to force (Nakasone) to retract (it)."
    The LDP is putting up its own candidates only in Iwate and
western Shimane but it is supporting independents jointly with
other parties in other prefectures.
    A close aide to Nakasone, who asked not to be identified,
said he sees the sales tax having little impact on the local
elections since almost all candidates, irrespective of party
affiliation, are opposing it in prefectural assembly polls.

<dateline>    JOHANNESBURG, March 19 - </dateline>Some 7,000 black workers returned
to work after staging one-day strikes at two mines on Monday,
the National Union of Mineworkers and the companies that own
the mines said.
    About 6,000 miners resumed work at the Grootvlei gold mine
east of Johannesburg after protesting the transfer of
colleagues to other jobs at the same mine, owners General
Mining Union Corp Ltd <GENM.J> said.
    The union said about 1,000 mineworkers at a new coal
facility owned by Anglo American Corp of South Africa Ltd
<ANGL.J> also returned to their jobs on Tuesday.
    The workers at Anglo's Vaal Colliery south of Johannesburg
had struck to protest the alleged refusal of officials of the
South African homeland of Transkei to allow miners to attend a
funeral in the homeland, a union spokesman said.

<title>RECENT U.S. OIL DEMAND UP 0.1 PCT FROM YEAR AGO</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, March 25 - </dateline>U.S. oil demand as measured by
products supplied rose 0.1 pct in the four weeks ended March 20
to 16.16 mln barrels per day from 16.15 mln in the same period
a year ago, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said.
    In its weekly petroleum status report, the Energy
Department agency said distillate demand was off 0.1 pct in the
period to 3.258 mln bpd from 3.260 mln a year earlier.
    Gasoline demand averaged 6.72 mln bpd, off 1.2 pct from
6.80 mln last year, while residual fuel demand was 1.38 mln
bpd, off 2.1 pct from 1.41 mln, the EIA said.
    Domestic crude oil production was estimated at 8.35 mln
bpd, down 7.8 pct from 9.06 mln a year ago, and gross daily
crude imports (excluding those for the SPR) averaged 3.44 mln
bpd, up 16.3 pct from 2.95 mln, the EIA said.
    Refinery crude runs in the four weeks were 11.90 mln bpd,
up 1.4 pct from 11.74 mln a year earlier, it said.
    In the first 78 days of the year, refinery runs were up 1.8
pct to an average 12.25 mln bpd from 12.04 mln in the year-ago
period, the EIA said.
    Year-to-date demand for all petroleum products averaged
16.32 mln bpd, up 1.8 pct from 16.04 mln in 1986, it said.
    So far this year, distillate demand rose 0.1 pct to 3.31
mln bpd from 3.30 mln in 1986, gasoline demand was 6.60 mln
bpd, up 0.1 pct from 6.59 mln, and residual fuel demand fell
0.4 pct to 1.42 mln bpd from 1.43 mln, the EIA said.
    Year-to-date domestic crude output was estimated at 8.41
mln bpd, off 7.7 pct from 9.11 mln a year ago, while gross
crude imports averaged 3.96 mln bpd, up 28.1 pct from 3.09 mln,

<text>
<title>GROWTH OF PALM OIL USE SET TO SLOW, OUTPUT TO RISE</title>
<dateline>    ANTWERP, June 18 - </dateline>The rate of increase in world palm oil
use is likely to slow next season despite an expected 800,000
tonne production rise to 8.13 mln tonnes, Siegfried Mielke,
editor of the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said.
    He told the 8th Antwerp Oils and Fats Contact Days that in
the next Oct/Sept 1987/88 season, palm oil use will rise to
8.25 mln tonnes from 7.71 mln, below the five-year average
increase of 550,000 tonnes.
     Opening stocks at the start of next October are expected
to be about 1.4 mln tonnes, 300,000 tonnes below year-earlier
levels, bringing total supplies to 9.5 mln tonnes, he said.
    The anticipated total supplies will be about 500,000 tonnes
above this season's available amount, Mielke said.
    The increase in mature palm tree areas in Malaysia will
slow down from this year on, but that will be offset by area
expansion in Indonesia, he said.
    He estimated the combined rise in Malaysian and Indonesian
mature area at 8.7 pct next year, after 9.5 pct this year, and
at 6.7 pct in 1989 and 5.0 pct in 1990.
    Malaysia also is shifting plantings to Sabah and Sarawak,
where the rate of expansion is higher than in the Peninsula,
but where yields are lower, he said.
     The stocks/usage ratio of seven major oils is also
expected to decline, Mielke said. The oils are soybean,
cottonseed, sunflowerseed, coconut, rapeseed, palmkernel and
palm.
    At the start of October 1986 stocks of these oils were
unusually high and represented 6.8 weeks of the current
season's prospective demand, compared with six weeks a year ago
and with 5.4 weeks in 1984, he said.
    Mielke expects the ratio to fall to 5.9 weeks by the start
of next October and to the unusually low level of 5.4 weeks by
the end of next season.
    The stocks/usage ratio for palm oil was 11.4 weeks last
October and is likely to be 8.7 weeks next October and 7.7 at
the end of next season, Mielke said.
    World oilseed stocks also are expected to fall in the
course of the next season, with the biggest reduction seen in
soybean stocks, which Mielke expects to decline by 5.0 mln
tonnes or by one fifth.
    Almost all of the decline is expected to occur in the U.S.,
for which he estimated ending stocks next season at 10.7 mln
tonnes, or 393 mln bushels, against anticipated ending stocks
of 15 mln tonnes, or 551 mln bushels, at the end of this
season.

into a contractual agreement with <Okamoto U.S.A. Inc> to
market condoms manufactured by Okamoto's parent company,
Okamoto Riken Gomu Co Ltd of Japan.
    Pacad president David Tucker said the agreement covered the
entire U.S. and Caribbean.
    "With mounting public health concerns we expect our condom
sales to begin within 30 days and grow rapidly in 1987," Tucker
said. "We find perception of quality and value in Japanese
products is just now crossing over from cars and cameras to
condoms."

<title>CITICORP <CCI> DENIES RUMORS OF DEBT WRITEDOWN</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 13 - </dateline>Citicorp denied financial market
rumors that it has written off some of its loans to Latin
American debtors,
    "Rumors that we have written off any of our Latin American
debt are unfounded," a Citicorp spokesman told Reuters in
response to London-based rumors in the money markets.
    Citicorp is the largest bank group in the U.S. and one of
the biggest lenders to Latin America, with some eight to nine
billion dlrs outstanding to Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, bank
analysts said.
    In response to more specific market rumors that it had
taken action on its exposure to Brazil, Citicorp said it made
an 8-K filing on the subject with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on Tuesday in relation to a registration statement
for a preferred stock issue.
    Citing the filing, Citicorp said that Brazil's recent
suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of
commercial bank debt and related actions "may require Citicorp
to place 3.9 billion dlrs of intermediate and long-term
Brazilian loans on a cash basis."
    When loans are placed on a cash basis, interest or
principal payments are only booked when received instead of
being accrued on their due dates, analysts noted.
    However, Citicorp said in the 8-K filing that "it is
premature to make such a decision at this time in view of the
fluidity of the situation and management's high confidence in
the long-term outlook for Brazil."
    Brazil's new central bank governor Francisco Gros met
senior commercial bankers here on Wednesday and Citicorp said
formal talks on Brazil's recent actions and future financing
needs should begin in "the near future".
    Citicorp said in the filing, "the issue will be
re-evaluated at the end of the first quarter."
    The bank group continued, "if it is decided that these
loans to Brazil should be placed on a cash basis, Citicorp
estimates, based on existing interest rates, that the impact in
the first quarter would be approximately 50 mln dlrs after tax
and for the full year would be approximately 190 mln dlrs after
tax."
    It added that these amounts include interest accrued in
1986 that has not yet been collected.
    Although Citicorp denied earlier rumors of major loan
writedowns, its warning that it may have to place some of its
Brazilian loans on non-accrual unnerved many Wall Street
investors.
    The common stock price was down one dlr to 51-1/8 after the
first hour on a volume of over 500,000 shares.
    However, Lawrence Cohn, analyst at Merrill Lynch and Co
Inc, said that the market's nervousness was not really
warranted.
    "Citicorp can afford it," he said. "The amounts they are
talking about are peanuts."

<title>SWISS BANKER SAYS COUNTRIES SEEK NEW DEBT ANSWERS</title>
<dateline>    WASHINGTON, April 9 - </dateline>Countries meeting at the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) this week are looking at a
variety of new ways to resolve the problem of third world debt,
Swiss National Bank president Pierre Languetin said.
    Languetin said meetings of the Group of 10 and the IMF
Interim Committee today reached a consensus that a rescheduling
like that of Mexico's debt must be the last of its kind. The
Mexico rescheduling has still not been finally resolved six
months after it started. Various members suggested other
options to break the deadlock between debtor countries and
their creditors, he said.
    Languetin said no recommendations were agreed, but he
listed some of the suggestions.
    One involved individual banking systems each resolving the
problem of small banks which refused to participate in
reschedulings. It was this problem that had prevented
completion of the Mexican rescheduling, he said.
    Debt-equity swaps could be expanded, as could 'on-lending',
which some banks had proposed for Argentine debt. 'On-lending'
allows banks to select customers for rescheduled amounts.
    Small banks which did not wish to reschedule might be
forced to sign "exit bonds," prohibiting them from lending to
that country again, he said.
    Languetin said none of these represented a general view.
But he added "People are trying to get out of the corset."

<title>LITTLE JOY FOR SWISS EXPORTERS, STUDY SAYS</title>
<dateline>    BERNE, March 13 - </dateline>The continued strength of the Swiss franc
against the dollar will largely deprive Swiss exporters of the
benefits of the upturn in the world economy, a quarterly study
by the Economics Department said.
    It said the export industry would scarcely get a boost from
the upturn in the economies of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD), and predicted declines in
new orders for highly export-orientated firms.
    However, domestic demand, which stagnated in the last
quarter of 1986, would resume its growth, fuelled by higher
real incomes and buoyant consumer sentiment, it said.
    The study, which was drawn up by the department's
Commission for Economic Questions, said industrial production
would scarcely increase, with most firms apparently happy with
current numbers of workers.
    However, an increase in labour demand in the service sector
should help push up total employment, it said.
    The Commission also predicted an increase in inflation from
current low levels.

<title>U.S. PAYMENTS GAP TO PERSIST, EX-FED CHIEF SAYS</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 9 - </dateline>The dollar will decline over the next
two to three years, but this is unlikely to result in a
complete reduction of the U.S. current account deficit, said
Anthony Solomon, chairman of S.G. Warburg (USA) Inc and former
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
    In a presentation to the Japan Society, Solomon said
without elaboration that he expects a "significant decline in
the dollar," within the next three years.
    "The dollar will fall more, but the current account deficit
will stop being reduced when it reaches its structural core,"
he said.
    Solomon described the structural core as about one-half of
the current 150 billion dlr annual deficit. He cited several
factors which will prevent an elimination of the deficit.
    For one thing, it is unlikely that there will be any new
investment in those manufacturing industries that shrank when
the dollar was at uncompetitive levels, he said.
    In addition, he said that the U.S. has an increased
propensity to import in order to satisify consumer tastes.
    Solomon forecast inflation at 4.5 pct by year-end, but said
it could be kept below five pct in the medium-term if oil
prices are stable and commodity values remain low.

<title>INDUSTRIAL ACTION ENDS AT SOUTH AFRICAN MINE</title>
<dateline>    JOHANNESBURG, April 2 - </dateline>About 8,000 black miners returned
to work after a week-long industrial action at South Africa's
largest gold mine, mine owner Anglo American Corp of South
Africa Ltd <ANGL.J> said.
    A spokesman for the mining house said the action started on
Wednesday last week when thousands of miners staged a go-slow
at One underground shaft of the Free State Geduld division of
Free State Consolidated Gold Mines Ltd <FSCN.J>.
    The action later escalated into an underground sit-in at
the mine over the weekend, prompting management to close the
affected shaft because of what the company described as "the
creation of unsafe working conditions."
    Anglo American spokesman John Kingsley-Jones said the
company held talks with the National Union of Mineworkers
(NUM), South Africa's biggest trade union which claims a
membership of 360,000 black workers, but failed to establish
the cause of worker dissatisfaction. He acknowledged that the
mine suffered a loss of production, but declined to give
estimates.
    Free State Consolidated last year produced 104 tonnes of
gold from 28 underground shafts.
    The NUM was not immediately available for comment on the
action. But a spokesman for the union earlier told the South
African Press Association that miners had been locked out of
the mine at the weekend after staging a strike in protest
against being ordered to carry bags containing explosives as
well as food for white miners.

<title>DAYTON HUDSON <DH> NOT INTERESTED IN ACQUISITION</title>
<dateline>    MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., June 19 - </dateline>Dayton Hudson Corp, in a
letter to employees, said it told an "aggressive buyer" of the
company's stock that it does not want to be acquired.
    A Dayton Hudson spokeswoman would not identify the buyer,
but Wall Street sources said Dart Group Corp <DARTA.O> was the
company interested in buying Dayton Hudson stock.
    The Wall Street sources said the Dart Group is expected
soon to file a statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on its accumulation of Dayton Hudson stock.
    According to the letter to company employess, Dayton Hudson
management has moved in two directions to fend off a takeover.
According to the letter, chairman Kenneth Macke expressed to
the group buying its stock the company's desire to remain
independent.
    Dayton Hudson Thursday night met with Minnesota governor
Rudy Perpich, appealing for legislative help.
    A spokesman for Governor Perpich earlier said the governor
is expected later today to recommend stiffening the state's
anti-takeover law to help the Minneopolis retailer defend
itself.
    Minnesota House speaker designate said the legislators
would probably look at language similar to that contained in
Indiana and New York law. He said any amendment proposed would
probably be designed to thwart a company from dismantling a
company for its own profit.
   "Obviously Dayton-Hudson people feel whatever statutes we
have would not protect them enough," Vanasek said.

<title>DIAGNOSTIC PRODUCTS <DPCZ> SEES EARNINGS GROWTH</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 2 - </dateline>Diagnostic Products Corp president and
chief executive officer Sigi Ziering said he expects to
maintain the same compound average annal net income growth in
1987 as the company has for the past five years.
    "We expect the same performance in net income over the next
five years as we have had in the past," Ziering said.
    Over the past five years Ziering said the company has had
average compound net income growth of 32 pct annually with a 27
pct per year growth in earnings per share. For 1986 the company
had net income of 6.3 mln dlrs, or 1.07 dlrs per share, vs 3.9
mln dlrs, or 73 cts per share in 1985.
    Diagnostic manufactures medical immunological diagnostic
test kits.
    Ziering said he expects the earnings growth to result from
positive effect of the weaker dollar on the company's exports
sales as well as accelerated market penetration. Ziering said
he expected the Food and Drug Administration to approve three
more of its drug abuse test kits by the end of the year, which,
depending on approval, should also help earnings growth.
    Ziering said as a result of the new tax laws he expected
the company's taxes to decrease by five pct to 31 pct of net
income in 1987.

<title>TOYOTA SAYS IT ONLY STUDYING LUXURY UNIT PLANS</title>
<dateline>    DETROIT, June 1 - </dateline>Toyota Motor Co's <TOYO.T> U.S. sales
subsidiary said it has been studying the possibility of forming
a new division to market upscale cars, but denied a published
report that it would announce a startup decision this year.
    Toyota spokesman Jerry Giaquinta told Reuters: "All we're
saying at this point is we'be been studying the luxury,
performance segment and no final decision has been made on
whether to enter it or which or several options to follow."
    The trade paper Automotive News reported in this week's
edition that Toyota will announce such a  division in a move
similar to rival Honda Motor Co's <HMC> Acura car division.
    The Toyota spokesman said, "The Automotive News article is
based on speculative assumptions."
    The paper said Toyota has already identified 100 key
dealers who would be offered the "unnamed new franchise" that
would open in the 1989 model year with "three
luxury-performance car lines."
    It also said the new Toyota luxury line would have prices
likely to start arpund 16,000 dlrs and going to the
"high-20,000-dlr range" to appeal to buyers of European and
American luxury buyers.

<text>
<title>JARDINE MATHESON PLANS FOUR-FOR-ONE BONUS ISSUE</title>
<dateline>    HONG KONG, March 27 - </dateline>Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd
<JARD.HKG> said it planned a bonus issue of four new "B" shares
of 20 H.K. Cents each for every ordinary share of par value two
dlrs.
    A company statement said the firm expects to pay a total
1987 dividend of four cents per "B" share, while the "A" share
dividend will be maintained at last year's level of 40 cents a
share.
    Jardine Matheson announced earlier a 205 pct jump in 1986
net profits to 479 mln dlrs from 157 mln in 1985.
    Shareholders' funds increased to 5.02 billion dlrs from
4.77 billion in 1985, the statement said.
    It quoted chairman Simon Keswick as saying Jardine Matheson
achieved the good performance through satisfactory results in
most sections, especially Hong Kong Land Co Ltd <HKLD.HKG>,
Jardine Fleming Co Ltd, and its business in Japan.
    He said the group's stake of about 35 pct in Hong Kong
Land, which will be lowered to 26 pct after the completion of a
reorganisation, is "a long term investment and now stands at a
level which causes us no financial strain or problems of asset
imbalance."
    Keswick said the issue of new "B" shares will give the group
"the flexibility in the future to issue ordinary shares for
expansion without jeopardising the shareholding stability which
has been brought about through the group's recent
restructuring."
    He said the new issue is pending approval from both the
firm's shareholders and warrant holders, adding an appropriate
adjustment will be made to the warrant exercise price.
    The Jardine group has nearly completed its reorganisation,
with Jardine Matheson transferring its control of Hk Land to
the new unit <Jardine Strategic Holdings Ltd>.
    Jardine Strategic will also hold majority stakes in the two
companies spun off from Hk Land -- <Mandarin Oriental
International Ltd> and <Dairy Farm International Holdings Ltd>
-- plus cross holdings with Jardine Matheson.
    Jardine Matheson, which had debts of about 2.7 billion dlrs
last year, will become debt free after the restructuring.
    "A positive cash flow from operations and disposals,
continuing into 1987, has transformed our balance sheet,"
Keswick said. He noted the firm last year sold interests in
airfreight operations, Australian properties and trucking
business, and its remaining U.S. Oil and gas activities.
    Jardine Matheson decided to make a provision against its
general trading business in the Middle East in view of the
continuing weakness of oil prices, Keswick said. But he said
the operations would be profitable in the longer term.
    He said the firm's function "has evolved into one primarily
of strategy, structure and financial and personnel policy."
    He said Jardine Matheson will reduce the size of the board
of directors but will simultaneously create a new Pacific
regional board. He gave no further details of the change.
    Jardine Matheson shares rose 20 cents to 24.90 dlrs at
midday on the Hong Kong stock market. In early trading it had
fallen to 24.30 dlrs because of rumours yesterday that the firm
planned a rights issue.

<dateline>    NEW YORK, March 25 - </dateline>CPC International Inc officials said
the sale of the company's European corn wet milling business
will remove about 700 mln dlrs of debt and liabilities from

total debt by about one-third this year. At the end of 1986,
CPC's debt totaled about 1.5 billion dlrs.
    The officials also said the company has no current plans to
sell its U.S. or North American corn wet milling businesses.
    CPC's 1987 capital spending is budgeted at about 250 mln
dlrs, down from about 361 mln dlrs last year, the officials
told analysts.

<title>STOLTENBERG SAYS PARIS ACCORD POLICY TO CONTINUE</title>
<dateline>    BONN, April 3 - </dateline>West German Finance Minister Gerhard
Stoltenberg said the currency agreement reached in Paris in
February had been successful and would be continued.
    Stoltenberg told journalists before he attends next week's
International Monetary Fund meeting in Washington that: "The ...
Strategy to stabilise currencies around current levels has
proven its worth and will also determine future developments."
    Stoltenberg declined to comment specifically on what he
would consider to be an undervalued dollar but said a dollar
around 1.80 marks created problems for West Germany's exports.
    He said studies by international organisations had made it
clear that especially in the U.S. And in Japan major efforts
remained necessary to support adjustments in foreign trade
balances via necessary corrections to economic policy.
    "No-one would benefit if, after years of over-valuation, the
U.S. Dollar fell into the other extreme, that is, strong
under-valuation," he said.
    Stoltenberg said West Germany had a keen interest in a
swift agreement between the U.S. And Japan concerning the
current trade dispute over semi-conductors.
    Asked whether he believed the markets would test the Paris
currency accord, Stoltenberg did not comment specifically but
noted that much of what had been discussed in Paris had not
been published.
    The Paris declaration did not state the levels at which
central banks of the major industrialised countries would
intervene. Stoltenberg said that everything had been carefully
considered. He said he had nothing further to add.

<title>COLOMBIA JAN EXPORTS UP BUT COFFEE VALUES FALL</title>
<dateline>    Bogota, april 9 - </dateline>The value of colombian exports other than
coffee rose 55 pct in january compared with the same period
last year, apparently setting a trend for the trade balance in
1987, government statistics institute figures show.
    They amounted to 180.8 mln dlrs fob compared with 147.5 mln
dlrs for coffee, a drop of 42 pct from last year.
    The trade balance registered a 35 mln dlr surplus, compared
with a 56 mln dlr surplus in january 1986.
    The national planning department forecast that in 1987
coffee, colombia's traditional major export, will account for
only one-third of total exports, or about 1.5 billion dlrs.

<title>CHASE'S LABRECQUE SAYS STOCK DROP UNWARRANTED</title>
<dateline>    DALLAS, Texas, Oct 19 - </dateline>Chase Manhattan Corp (CMB)
president Thomas Labrecque said the sharp decline in the stock
market was not justified by economic conditions and there was a
need for perspective by investors on fundamental economic
conditions.
    "If we are right about the fundamentals, this thing should
settle down," Labrecque said at a news conference at the
American Bankers Associatioon annual convention here.
    Labrecque also said the stock market drop could cause U.S.
monetary officials to ease credit policies.
    Inflation fears are exaggerated and Chase still believes
inflation will not rise much beyond five percent this year,
Labrecque said.
   He said strong economic conditions would permit growth to
continue well into 1988.
    "I don't think the stock market will cause a recession,"
Labrecque said.
    He said he could not estimate what the impact on Chase from
the stock market fall would be. Chase's stock price, however,
dropped 23 pct, but other money center banks suffered even
sharper losses.
    Referring to the banking industry, he said: "We're talking
about one day."
    "These are strong institutions," he said. Labrecque said he
did not think the Federal Reserve Board would tighten monetary
policy in view of the stock market's behavior.
    "If there is a bias I expect it would be a little bit the
other way," he said. Labrecque said the high U.S. budget deficit
was not the single most important factor behind the market's
worries.
    He called for closer cooperation in economic policy by the
United States, West Germany, Japan and Britain.

<title>TOP QUALITIES SOUGHT ON HAMBURG COFFEE MARKET</title>
<dateline>    HAMBURG, March 30 - </dateline>The green coffee market saw some demand
for high quality coffees in the past week, but business was
described as generally unsatisfactory, trade sources said.
    Especially sought were spot East African and Ethiopian and
some Brazils, they said, adding that some high grade robustas
also met some demand.
    Sporadic business was noted in the second hand which
offered Kenya coffee for May/June shipment up to 25 dlrs below
origin levels.
    Roasters are said to be well covered and are not expected
to enter the market for larger purchases in the near term.

<title>COMEX SILVER FUTURES CLOSE ON HIGHS</title>
<dateline>    NEW YORK, April 7 - </dateline>Comex silver futures made session highs
on the close, settling with gains of 18.5 to 20.4 cents.
Settling prices also set new highs for the recent move, as
speculative buying overcame midsession profit taking.
    Locals and commercial traders who went short today,
expecting a corrective move, bought back positions. Those who
went long weeks ago are still reluctant to sell, traders said.
    Analysts said speculators continue to find silver a bargain
relative to gold and are snapping up the metal as a cheap
inflation hedge.
    May closed 18.5 cents higher at 6.765 dlrs. July was up
18.7 cents at 6.841 dlrs. Open interest at yesterday's close
rose to 109,534 contracts, a new high for the move. Estimated
volume today was 38,500 lots, including 4,326 switches.

<title>U.S. BANKS TO GET APPROVAL FOR SECURITIES BUSINESS</title>
<dateline>    TOKYO, March 11 - </dateline>U.S. Commercial banks are expected to
receive Finance Ministry approval in late April to operate
securities subsidiaries in Japan, U.S. Bank officials said.
    A senior official at one of four prospective banks said the
ministry told his bank it would give approval as long as the
parent firm holds no more than 50 pct of the capital.
    "We expect the ministry to give us permission by the end of
April," he said.
    <J.P. Morgan and Co>, Bankers Trust New York Corp <BT.N>,
Manufacturers Hanover Corp <MHC.N> and Chemical New York Corp
<FNBF.N> have asked for securities business licenses.
    Ministry officials declined to say when they would give
formal approval, but said they were working on the issue.
    Approval would pave the way for U.S. Commercial banks to
underwrite and trade equities in Japan under their own names.
    Citicorp <CCI.N> and Chase Manhattan Corp <CMB.N> have
already entered the Japanese securities market by acquiring
U.K. Securities houses already operating in Japan. Citicorp
took over <Vickers de Costa Ltd> and Chase bought <Laurie
Milbank and Co>.
    Bankers did not know if all the banks would get licenses,
but said J.P. Morgan probably would as it was first to ask.

<title>P AND O PLANS WARRANT ISSUE TO MARK ANNIVERSARY</title>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 24 - </dateline>Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation
Co Plc <PORL.L>, P and O, said it plans a free warrant issue on
the basis of 10 warrants for every 150 stg nominal of deferred
stock already held, to mark the 150th anniversary of the
company.
    Each warrant will give the right to subscribe for one stg
nominal of deferred stock at 750p during a specified period in
the five years starting in 1988.
    P and O deferred shares were last quoted at 629p, down 1p
since yesterday, after the company reported 1986 pre-tax profit
of 174.1 mln stg against 125.6 mln for 1985.
    P and O said 1986 produced an acceptable level of growth,
though ground has to be made up in one or two areas.
    The company has a strong balance sheet and considerable
flexibility for 1987, it added. P and O will concentrate on
expanding in its established market sectors.
    Commenting on the recent ferry disaster in the North Sea
off Zeebrugge, the statement said the precise cause is unknown.
The company has instituted an immediate investigation and both
the British and Belgian governments are conducting inquiries.
    The stricken ferry, the Herald of Free Enterprise, belongs
to Townsend Thoresen, which became part of P and O in January.
    P and O is considering listing its shares in Japan and
other important overseas financial centres, the statement
added.

<title>NATIONAL SAVINGS MOVE POINTS TO LOWER U.K. RATES</title>
<author>    By Geert Linnebank, Reuters</author>
<dateline>    LONDON, March 11 - </dateline>U.K. Interest rates look set to move
lower even after Monday's half-point cut in bank base rates to
10-1/2 pct, analysts said, citing as evidence the suspension of
a British National Savings issue yesterday.
    The Department of National Savings, effectively a Treasury
Department unit, yesterday suspended its 32nd issue, launched
in October and paying a high tax-free 8-3/4 pct on five-year
private investments between 25 and 5,000 stg. A spokesman said
the suspension was just a reaction to yields on national
savings bonds being way out of line with the rest of the
market.
    The move was followed by a surprise sell-out within minutes
today of a Bank of England one-billion stg tap issue, the
second such issue in as many weeks, analysts noted.
    They said the near-instant sale of the entire new gilts
issue, for which the Bank of England had required a high 40 pct
downpayment, was clear evidence that the market thought rates
had to drop sooner rather than later.
    The sale of the tranche of 8-3/4 pct treasury bonds due
1997 occurred in an active, bullish gilts market as downward
pressure on money market rates remained intact, with the
bellwether three-month interbank rate down 1/8 point at
10-9-7/8 pct.
     It coincided with another strong sterling rally which
pushed the pound to four-year highs against the dollar.
    "That government stock disappeared very quickly indeed," said
Stephen Lewis, head of economic research at stockbrokers
Phillips and Drew; "It is an indication that the market believes
rates are going to fall further ... At least by a half-point
immediately after the budget (on March 17), and some people
hope for more."
    Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by the
National Savings Department was "of considerable significance."
    It said, "the real message ... Is that the decks are being
quickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by the
building societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut
in bank base rates to 10 pct materialises."
    Building societies have said a drop in bank base rates
would normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to a
reduction in mortgage lending rates.
    Lewis of Phillips and Drew said he too believed the
National Savings issue suspension may reflect new U.K. Treasury
policy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut.
    "National Savings has been competing too effectively with
the building societies of late. Building society income has
been depressed in recent months," he said.
    He and other analysts said Chancellor of the Exchequer
Nigel Lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lid
on U.K. Inflation.
    Underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in Britain
than in most other Western economies with inflation seen rising
well above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 after
last year's 3.7 pct.
    Emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumer
prices, Lewis said a one-point cut in building society rates
would reduce inflation in Britain by about 0.4 pct.
    But Lewis and others noted that building societies had been
complaining to the government about intense competition from
National Savings, which they argued reduced the scope for early
mortgage rate cuts.
    "The Chancellor need not be worried about losing some PSBR
funding from National Savings, but he must be taking the
building societies' criticism to heart. It looks like the
National Savings move reflects this," one senior dealer said.
    A Savings Department spokesman refused to comment on this
interpretation, saying the suspension of the issue was merely a
reaction to the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates, which had
pushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line with
the rest of the market.
    "We are not politically motivated ... Funding was just
becoming too expensive and we don't need all that money," he
told Reuters, adding the department had suspended issues at
least twice in the past, when offered interest rates were above
or below market rates.
    He said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late as
U.K. Money market rates continued their steady decline and
income was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billion
stg target set for fiscal 1986 ending March 31.
    In the first 10 months of fiscal 1986, National Saving's
contribution to government funding totalled 2.72 billion stg,
compared with 2.01 billion stg in the same period of the
previous year, official figures show.
    Figures for February, out on Monday, are expected to show a
further increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg, pushing the
total for 11 months above target, government officials said.

<title>ECUADOR CRUDE OIL OUTPUT TO RESUME NEXT MONTH</title>
<dateline>    QUITO, April 9 - </dateline>Ecuador is due to resume limited crude oil
output on May 8 when a new 43 km pipeline to neighbouring
Colombia should be finished, an energy ministry spokesman said.
    Oil output was halted on March 5 by an earthquake which
damaged 50 km of the main pipeline linking jungle oilfields at
Lago Agrio to the Ecuadorean port of Balao on the Pacific.
    About 13 km of the new link, capable of carrying some
50,000 barrels per day (bpd), has been built, he said.
    Ecuador pumped 245,000 to 250,000 bpd before the
earthquake.
    The new link will connect Lago Agrio to Puerto Colon in
Colombia, the starting point of Columbia's pipeline to the
Pacific ocean port of Temuco.
    The government estimates it will take about four more
months to repair the Lago Agrio to Balao pipeline and return
output to normal levels, the spokesman said.

<title>FRENCH GDP SHOULD RISE 2.3 PCT IN 1988 - MINISTRY</title>
<dateline>    PARIS, March 23 - </dateline>French gross domestic product should grow
by 2.3 pct in 1988 after two pct growth this year and 2.1 pct
in 1986, the Finance Ministry said.
    The latest forecast, prepared by the National Accounts and
Budget Commission, assumed an exchange rate of 6.20 francs to
the dollar this year and next and an average oil import price
rising to 18.9 dlrs a barrel next year from 17.4 dlrs this year
and 14.7 in 1986.
    The Commission, headed by Finance minister Edouard
Balladur, forecast a fall in consumer price inflation to two
pct year-on-year at end-1988 from 2.4 pct at end 1987 and 2.1
pct last year.
    In annual average terms inflation would fall to two pct in
1988 from 2.5 pct this year and 2.7 pct last year, it said.
    Trade should show a one billion franc annual surplus this
year and next after last year's 0.5 billion surplus, it added.
    Employment should rise by 0.1 pct a year over the next two
years while the state budget deficit should be cut to 2.2 pct
of GDP in 1988 from 2.6 pct this year and 2.9 pct in 1986.
    Other forecasts prepared by the Commission indicated a 1.8
pct 1988 rise in household purchasing power, up from 1.1 pct
this year but less than last year's 2.9 pct, and a 1.6 pct rise
in household consumption, compared with this year's 1.5 pct and
last year's 2.9 pct.
    Business investment is forecast to rise four pct a year
this year and next after 3.7 pct last year, with private sector
productive investment rising 4.9 pct in 1988 after a six pct
rise this year and 5.5 pct in 1986.
    The Ministry said updated forecasts would be prepared
before the autumn to serve as the basis for the 1988 budget,
which the government is now preparing for presentation in
September.
